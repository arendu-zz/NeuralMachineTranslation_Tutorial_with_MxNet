the average depth is about two miles .
but see all those different working things ?
it 's a colonial animal .
they 're very little understood .
you can actually see through his head .
this is kind of like an undersea rooster .
they do n't catch them in a net .
this is one of these hydrothermal vents .
these are called tube worms .
that 's how they like to live .
on the back , you see this again .
those pillars get up to several stories .
it 's actually a light-@@ sensing organ .
we 're moving up one of these pillars .
this one 's several stories tall .
here 's crabs here , worms here .
here 's pa@@ go@@ da structures .
there 's a fish sitting here .
the worms are growing inches per week !
i 'll end up with saying one thing .
it 's an incredible story .
it 's absurd . it 's just absurd .
the concept of preservation is futile .
why as a result , what happens ?
the lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
last in europe gdp per capita .
and these are facts , guys .
we do n't value play .
in fact , we de@@ value play .
social : 45 years of what ?
to be really , really serious .
-lrb- applause -rrb- be serious .
we have a serious meme running through .
it 's a serious gene .
it 's a crap system .
what a crime . what a crime .
what are qualities of a bulg@@ arian work ?
we have the serious meme in us .
well i 'm going to say no .
play : our brains are hardwired for play .
maybe you did n't know that .
it 's the ones that play more .
it 's a universal thing - we play .
humans . we play sports .
it is a huge benefit .
as a result , what happens ?
these are the benefits to play .
what does this world look like ?
is it fun ? is it playful ?
is it fun ? is it playful ?
in fact , play improves our work .
for example , it stimul@@ ates creativity .
it increases our openness to change .
it improves our ability to learn .
we should n't be feeling guilty .
we should be celebrating play .
quick example from the corporate world .
people , service , profit .
no way . we 're different . "
one , play is universal .
not one customer would refer us .
i 'm going to encourage constructive criticism .
i 'm going to let you challenge authority .
we 're going to eradicate fear .
fear is the enemy of play .
let them be on the internet .
let them be on instant messengers .
let them take long lunches .
lunch is like the recess for work .
is that all there was ? "
what we need is a players ' uprising .
what we need is a players ' uprising .
seriously , we need to band together .
today is the start of the uprising .
this chart shows you the performance of countries .
educators like to talk about equity .
opportunities are unequ@@ ally distributed .
let 's look at this in greater detail .
let 's go back to the year 2000 .
people were stunned by the results .
every student knows what matters .
this is where success is systemic .
and this is the tower from below .
we have to get special flight clear@@ ance .
remi knows what love is .
he has the most impe@@ c@@ cable memory .
we are inve@@ ter@@ ate storytellers .
as a filmmaker , it worried me .
the films were curated and contex@@ tu@@ alized .
who was right , who wrong ?
what would they do under the same conditions ?
was the tale told well ?
was there a hidden message ?
he never mentioned that journey .
he was never right again .
so who gets to do it ?
the press started calling us .
let me take you on a little tour .
we reverse engineer lab equipment .
we like to build things .
then we like to take things apart .
and we make cells dance .
i 'm not going to minimize those concerns .
now , we follow state and local regulations .
so this stuff is just beginning .
it actually is a japanese beetle .
you can do a lot of things .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you very much .
i 'm trying to do this in english .
so i whistled along with him .
and i just could n't .
i would love to , but why ?
and i would have lost my face .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i lost my face .
why ? can i go away ? "
no , you ca n't .
actually it 's very simple .
so i whistle the tone .
you whistle the same tone as me .
-lrb- whistling -rrb- this is very promising .
okay , here it is .
did you guess the one that was dry ?
and we 're talking really small here .
you can see the difference .
so what are the applications ?
we 've certainly seen that today .
no water , no corro@@ sion .
it could be anti-@@ bacterial .
what 's in it for me ?
now , what 's going on here ?
now , that 's one barrier .
that is the notion of investment .
it 's very , very important .
this is a sneak preview .
he 's very shy , too .
he can place those exactly where he wants .
so , are we ready adam ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- tm : bra@@ vo .
this is a song that was recorded there .
the sound system was kind of decent .
and it 's been very exciting .
is that a kind of model for creativity ?
the music works perfectly in that setting .
it 's perfect for that particular context .
it 's smaller than this .
he wanted a bigger band .
they had to be very quiet .
this is a jazz band .
and a new form of music was born .
people are dancing , shouting and drinking .
and he 's singing right into your ear .
he 's whispering into your ears .
the effect is just electric .
and another new form of music was born .
one of the new ones is the automobile .
the car is a whole venue .
so that does n't really work .
and does it happen anywhere else ?
yeah . i think it 's evolutionary .
we already know where that passion is going .
and they 'll vote for that .
we do n't know people from iran .
it was a huge amount of pictures .
so here are a few of them .
" lebanon ? " " lebanon . "
i give you iran-@@ loves-israel . "
you have palest@@ ine-@@ loves-israel .
remember that image from the beginning ?
and it goes the other way around .
just read where those guys are from .
just people sending their pictures .
just raise that . exactly .
but i do n't buy anything new .
is it going to be my size ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
i call this " shiny tiger . "
monday : color is powerful .
who i 've got over .
so that became a challenge .
it 's a compound curve interior .
that 's the trailer , pretty much finished .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- a very different feeling .
in fact , imagine something even worse .
these glial cells become activated .
the nervous system has plasticity .
well , what do we do about that ?
we are talking about the high seas .
and how did we do that ?
it 's actually a bay .
it 's protecting five world heritage sites .
so stay tuned for further information .
this is a polio vaccine .
this is a great technology .
we can take it completely for granted .
people were terrified of this disease .
and it was because of scenes like this .
hundreds of people were paralyzed .
they had come from thousands of miles away .
but the message was very clear .
we 're not trying to control polio .
so it was a massive effort .
it 's just two drops , like that .
we should abandon this idea of eradication .
there 's absolutely no question .
these are children like umar .
umar was paralyzed for life .
we think children deserve better .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
now we 're in tough times economically .
help us tell the story .
it keeps getting re@@ infected .
they 're going to be the tough ones .
bg : now what about the money ?
and is it easy to raise that money ?
ba : it 's interesting .
and this is my postcard collection today .
i never did have someone . "
secrets can take many forms .
we all heard you pee . "
right . you know what i 'm saying .
and he emailed me this picture .
thank you for making your site .
he turns four tomorrow . "
secrets can take many forms .
i 'll say bye for now .
they 're 11 and 12 .
hold your head up . look at me .
explain to me what 's wrong .
why are you crying ? "
and he 's five years old .
i think back to my father .
he was a troubled kid .
he was being raised by his grandmother .
his grandmother had two jobs .
he was home alone a lot .
he was cool . he was fine .
we all looked up to him .
" hey anthony , come on upstairs . "
johnny call , you go .
so i run right upstairs .
there ai n't no first time .
folks , i 'm petrified .
and you put on the t-@@ 10 parachute .
you sit there , ok .
then they give you 10 minutes .
now you prepare for the inevitable .
you are going to hit the ground .
you ca n't delay that much .
and that 's not going to hurt .
this was my father in vietnam .
sort of leadership by humiliation .
and i also have to build their faith .
the mission did n't work .
also , the people had changed .
think about knowing that over time .
i probably learned the most about relationships .
think about it . it 's extraordinarily powerful .
i hope it 's not over .
this is n't easy stuff .
and it 's called affordability .
why i am not getting -lsb- any -rsb- ?
my god , it 's unbelievable .
-lrb- applause -rrb- play video one .
they are performing pu@@ ja .
i 'm sustaining on seventh year .
already 600 installations . what is my mission ?
i 'm doing something serious .
thank you very much . bye !
so i went to a party .
i talk to him for hours .
the surgeon emerged from the surgery .
and yet , he did not die .
mysteriously , he lived on .
he built a play@@ house for our daughter .
then another year goes by .
we take the kids to italy .
we take the kids to australia .
they 're exotic . they 're experimental .
there 's another drug out there .
he started it just two weeks ago .
perhaps there 's still hope ahead .
so what do i say ?
and terence died six days later .
it was also an expensive fight .
and what did i discover ?
yet i had that piece of paper .
i had them right at hand .
now , what do the experts call this ?
they say it 's denial .
the family wo n't listen to reason .
it 's not a bug .
maybe i wanted to believe it .
so what do we need ?
and he 's been a pretty good general .
and the poet tells him what to do .
and is n't that what we 're missing ?
hope is n't a bug .
where does choice come from ?
and that business is agriculture .
and i thought that was incredibly peculiar .
it also has very high cost implications .
but that is actually changing .
so all of this will transform farmers .
but it will create new opportunities .
and i had two questions in my head .
they want to get back to slower rhythms .
i think there are various reasons .
the drc is a dangerous place .
their marketing is slightly different .
it might just save their lives .
now , i want to ask a question .
that was easy . ok .
it 's a global trance .
i 'm now going to talk about feasibility .
that 's the wrong answer .
you wo n't be able to withstand them .
and that 's quite a thought .
and this is what it is .
15 years from the robust mouse .
and this turns out to be useful .
and there are only seven of them .
what can damage accumulate in ?
and you know what happened .
so , you know , this does happen .
not very long . ok .
ag : that 's right .
the water is completely black .
it 's flipping freezing in that water .
so it 's right up in the heavens .
that 's not the worst part of it .
i was gasping for air .
the warning signs are all there .
so thank you very , very much .
we use these every day .
does anyone know ? chi ?
it 's an ... i@@ phone@@ . iphone .
i like to read books on it .
you can experience their sense of place .
it was n't a real world out there .
it 's an intensely , intensely physical process .
and that does n't seem right .
it has to totally surrender .
that implies a lot of trust .
it 's not that simple .
the self : you are self-@@ aware .
thank god we are empathetic .
there 's no indian compassion .
there 's no american compassion .
it 's experienced by people occasionally .
love is something you discover .
i will come to it later .
maybe the swami is right .
compassion is going to be limited .
you learn swimming by swimming .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- you need to .
my predecess@@ or meant that .
you have to act compassionately .
that is where you fake .
if you know how to pray , pray .
with these words , thank you very much .
the tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters .
you 're just kind of moving around .
we 've learned an amazing amount .
it was very heavy , pretty uncomfortable .
but we 've come a long way .
thank you all very much .
of course , he 'd get really bored .
we get unbelievable segre@@ gation .
there 's an optional explanation if they want .
that did n't go over really well .
hence , the 2 sigma problem .
well , mark twain certainly thought so .
i took a couple victory laps in there .
could we do this all in real time ?
so how does it happen ?
o@@ hh@@ hhh , wo@@ www@@ w !
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
so what happened on this day ?
and who could have predicted any of this ?
and i asked myself , why ?
i felt shy , i felt embarrassed .
so , i decided to investigate .
i 'm telling you where i 'm insecure .
because what can you do with that data ?
or you could actually meet my need .
we talk about world peace .
this is nepal and tibet .
we carry that in us .
that 's a painting of a circle .
she did it in secret .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get out of town .
it 's something we knew how to do .
you might have a guess .
and our prison system itself is stuck .
that , i think , is movement .
that , i think , is movement .
that , i think , is movement .
if we could free ourselves from our education ?
what would these unseen forms look like ?
a simple volume , the cube .
and we can play with this .
we can begin to sculpt the form .
they can stretch . they can tear .
so let 's bring this process to architecture .
how ? and at what scale ?
i chose to design a column .
columns are architectural arche@@ types .
i started using four cylinders .
we can begin to zoom into them .
these forms are und@@ raw@@ able .
but it was very labor intensive .
but it is increasingly possible .
so where does this leave us ?
in short , we have no constraints .
ok , this is mount everest .
it 's 2@@ 9,@@ 0@@ 35 feet high .
everest is an extreme environment .
this is a view of base camp .
this is me crossing a crevas@@ se .
that 's another crevas@@ se .
okay . this is camp one .
they 're on fixed ropes here .
this is a view taken from camp three .
there 's no ice over it .
and this is at camp four .
this is a picture of rob hall .
it 's the first part of climb .
so that 's what happened .
the climbers got on the southeast ridge .
the summit would be in the foreground .
i have an oxygen hose connected here .
so each person climbs individually .
they picked the name for their baby .
this was my medical kit .
and this was scene at the lower camp .
the survivors came in one by one .
this climber was snow blind .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- he really said that .
he apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia .
this is a pretty evenly distributed scan .
he 's running out of energy .
there were five climbers lost here .
these are tibetan prayer flags .
i 'll show you some statistics .
that 's a four-@@ fold increase .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- even for amphibians .
it 's a pla@@ stici@@ zer .
but we also start out as aquatic organisms .
per@@ fl@@ ou@@ roo@@ ct@@ ano@@ ic acid .
this is my toxic baby .
i was n't the only one .
they 're both stories , interpretations .
it needs months and years .
it 's the whole book .
what happens when time warps ?
and that 's not all .
find other people reading those books .
how does one live inside distraction ?
it can not be stored .
at such moments , our selves are complete .
it threatens the flow of love .
we can choose to take time back .
so , the light bulb actually does that .
and this is what we 're pursuing here .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
and we also designed the condoms themselves .
-lrb- music -rrb- -lrb- laughter -rrb- get some .
so we rented this space .
you 've gotta sell something .
so there 's no stigma .
and that makes a happy family .
and we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .
we sell all the student books .
so the store actually did really well .
this is a secret identity kit .
you can read this quote .
and he could n't escape it .
so , i 'll go through really quickly .
always let the teachers lead the way .
there are a million ways .
this is a be@@ ef@@ al@@ o .
then there 's the li@@ ger .
it 's bigger than a tiger .
they did it with pigs .
they did it with puppies .
other states have banned them .
that dna is passed down through our mothers .
this lovely creature is an asian cockroach .
it 's not just insects .
they 've now created an organic robot .
this is miguel nico@@ le@@ lis of duke .
it 's pho@@ top@@ hi@@ lic .
this is where we are in this process .
this is what frankenstein 's lab looks like .
do we have free reign to design animals ?
now we 'll explain that in a second .
i can also make him spin .
we call this the orbiting mode .
all right , thank you , thomas .
and these are more practical applications .
-lrb- music -rrb- -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
do you know which group you 're in ?
but first , my disclo@@ sures .
i 'm not a radiologist .
radiologists were outraged by the guidelines .
but that very fact is telling .
and that proportion is primarily genetically determined .
but what else could i offer her ?
it 's just way too much equipment .
it 's like the essence of ted .
this is an image from our first patient .
this is our current detector .
our big break came in 2004 .
mbi generates four images per breast .
mri generates over a thousand .
first , know your density .
nice show . man , that was good !
bf : ... without a macarthur grant .
richard wurman : can i say something ?
it 's kind of neat . ok .
bf : no , shut up !
ok , here we go .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- dh : first one .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- what happened there ?
rw : do i get to hold them ?
dh : true . barry ...
dh : leap over my shoulder .
bf : up and over his shoulders .
bf : incredible , you say ?
dh : why bother , you say ?
bf : here we go .
bf : he invented the pencil .
bf : yeah , it 's all right .
bf : yeah , a little sketchy .
dh : everything up here 's ok ?
dh : then here we go .
dh : whenever you 're ready .
bf : there we go !
somebody dance ! come on !
dh : the french judge ...
bf : one more quick thing .
dh : that 's right .
oh , look how it lies there .
is that your final answer ?
dh : i do , i do .
dh : we will juggle seven .
bf : oh , oh , whoa .
dh : ... to back .
bf : thank you , that 's it .
bf : thank you guys !
so let me just start with my story .
and so we can regrow these surfaces biologically .
and the tissue 's very expensive .
we can harness those benefits .
we can do it as an outpatient procedure .
and so welcome to super bio@@ log@@ ics .
it 's version 2.0 of you .
but this is quite good .
and here you see just a selection .
it was 80 billion u.s. dollars .
they 're at the start of food chains .
even larger animals eat insects .
and they prepare it in a wonderful way .
more than 1,000 species - an enormous variety .
some fruits get some insect damage .
so anything is a good protein source already .
one gram of gold is 30 euros .
how are we going to feed this world ?
and we eat quite a lot of it .
they have the same share that we have .
pigs are quite like us .
we 're not taking the bonus yet .
so that 's two points for insects .
so that 's three points for insects .
so that 's four points for insects .
on the right-hand side you see a grasshopper .
it 's just very good food .
who would n't like to eat a shrimp ?
they are deli@@ ca@@ cies .
so why not eat insects ?
now , i know what you 're thinking .
that 's it . please save this .
and ... wikipedia is fixed , finally .
they serve food to poor people .
so here 's exhibit number one .
so here he is beginning .
here 's lesson number one .
this guy is no republican .
the mashup is owned by lucas .
the creator does n't have any rights .
so i did n't think much about it .
we need to speak of those values .
it 's a value respecting the creator .
this is completely different than automobiles .
there we go , the automobile .
i want to talk about this .
certainly we live in a competitive society .
this is sick beyond belief .
there was a whole lot of dialog .
this can not be . "
i 'm totally clu@@ eless .
do n't get too attached to him .
here 's what had to happen .
and now all of you understand it .
it kills me . i 'm not kidding .
what is the point ? "
that 's not true at all .
but i think that 's unlikely .
make me laugh . make me care .
so that was the goal of my design .
they have money and power .
that 's the responsibility of architects .
the color coordination is very important .
so this building became a permanent building .
and i was very lucky .
people suffer mentally and physically .
but it 's really necessary to do it .
i was very happy to hear that .
so this is under construction .
you do n't need to remember that .
it 's in the northeastern part of ethiopia .
and how old was she when she died ?
what do we actually know about our ancestors ?
but that care means also you learn .
you spend more time with your parents .
it supports your tongue from behind .
what does that tell us ? "
here 's the problem facing homer .
do people have grid cells ?
maybe it 's been towed .
also the noise will disappear in these pores .
ha . he 's ready .
so a microwave is a similar system .
so this is the specimen coming out now .
several times we can repeat that .
but i will do a trial .
let 's see . yeah , it worked .
we should stop looking outside .
play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
do another three hours ' work .
walk the dog . have sex again .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- we need to be realistic .
there 's got to be a middle way .
it 's totally dominated by work .
all of my relationships have failed .
now that can be daunting .
" what is worth dying for ? "
" what constitutes a good life ? "
values are a certain kind of fact .
and morality relates to these truths .
and these a@@ wait our discovery .
we 're not talking about connecticut .
the concept of physical health is undefined .
why would we think this ?
but it clearly ad@@ mits some exceptions .
on the left you have edward wit@@ ten .
i 'm not a fan . "
but this is just the point .
language seems to be really important here .
sh : really an honor . thank you .
they took off her colorful sari .
they broke her ban@@ gles .
she is also immensely pragmatic .
" he was flat@@ tered .
i also like rock and roll .
one night , she had a dream .
they were all tired of the fighting .
leymah and her sisters had had enough .
you can see the policeman 's face .
he looks embarrassed . he backs away .
and the peace accord was signed .
that 's the heat from the bottom .
and she is definitely on her way .
my friend looks at me totally blan@@ kly .
and what i 'm talking about is this .
we get it in the abstract .
i think this is a problem .
i 'll give you an analogy .
that 's when he falls .
think back for a moment to elementary school .
we learn these really bad lessons really well .
so let me tell you a story .
beth israel 's in boston .
everything seems to have gone fine .
so this is a huge practical problem .
but it 's also a huge social problem .
so this is a catastrophe .
i 've become the crazy wrongness lady .
and something else happened instead .
we come up with another idea .
maybe i 'm wrong . "
i went to northern liberia .
she was the laughing stock of the community .
she said , " that 's wei .
i wish to go with you .
i wish to go to school . "
i wish to go to school . "
she goes to school on the first day .
other countries come with different things .
it 's disheartening , it 's sad .
ju@@ an@@ ita is her name .
i wish for a better life .
i wish for food for my children .
i will fulfill the wish .
i failed to do this .
so i will do this .
we set up a foundation .
and this was at the beginning of elections .
they were able to mobilize young women .
he 's out of office today .
but how meaningful is this calculation , really ?
how much money can i save ?
leslie chan@@ g : one minute ?
ca : thanks so much for your talk .
and you all know roughly the story .
and cyrus makes a declaration .
he 'll let them return to their countries .
it 's a central document in jewish history .
who is there among you of his people ?
cyrus begins in the 5@@ 30s bc .
it had to be run in different languages .
all of those are respected by cyrus .
the greek inva@@ sions ended that .
but what cyrus represented remained absolutely central .
and it enters now another story .
it 's a great 19th century moment .
it can only be jehovah .
the question is , which god was it ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's 1879 .
you all know what happened .
and another story of the cylinder begins .
then another iran-@@ iraq war .
and the obvious emb@@ lem is cyrus .
it 's the only object they want .
they want to borrow the cyrus cylinder .
it was a huge event .
it stands with the american constitution .
it was february 3rd , 2008 .
all of you are members of tribes .
so here is the bottom line .
and so people form tribes .
but here 's the rub .
now here is the net out of this .
you 're all a member of tribes .
you do n't want this . okay ?
but let 's move on to stage two .
it will be despairing hostility .
actually , no , i 'm not .
you find them in all places in society .
the amount of world-changing behavior that would happen ?
in fact it would be basically ni@@ l .
and we park . and we stay .
notice people are appla@@ uding for us .
but you 'll notice the level of excitement .
what about martin luther king ?
two percent are at stage one .
in fact , that 's progress .
that 's called a tri@@ adic relationship .
and ultimately that adds to their values .
you know they do polls , right ?
pretty much everybody else who does polls .
so , they were bored .
incidentally , they did pull it off .
and they released the first-ever world poll .
you remember to talk all five culture stages .
we all know about the miracle of miniaturization .
this is a microfluidic chip that i developed .
and flowers are a real bug@@ ger .
why would they go to that bother ?
and sure enough , there 's the insect .
it 's a wonderful , amazing thing .
this one does n't smell so good .
this is the most amazing thing .
this thing does something else which is unusual .
so what is an insect seeing ?
that 's the main use of that filter .
we are all born artists .
they draw with crayons on the wall .
but you should n't worry .
all right ! it calls for celebration .
soon , a story develops .
in essence , they are not different .
he merely connected one sentence after another .
and you continue to make connections .
on his own , he wrote these sentences .
in other words , it 's useless .
but kids do n't mind .
they talk about these kinds of experiences .
playing does n't tire us .
we can play all night long .
you know this gentleman , right ?
but such a teacher is seldom found .
no crows are brought up .
that was duc@@ ha@@ mp .
our artistic desire does n't go away .
some people turn into rock@@ ers like this .
or some people dance in clubs .
so we start to envy them .
we easily say these sorts of things .
that 's what i think .
yes , that 's right .
it will say a lot of things .
the students go into a kind of trance .
they are devils . devils .
and they have a magic question .
but art is not for anything .
art is the ultimate goal .
that 's the world i dream of .
in 1990 , she was asked this question .
wow . i was touched .
enjoy it while it lasts .
so i can go back to my story .
and there are different ways .
first independent newspaper in slo@@ va@@ kia .
we were the best that they could do .
and here is the most stunning number .
what do we typically finance ?
and i want to offer you a deal .
six months later the newspaper was closed .
so it sounds like a great story .
the second angle , like in this clip .
now ours is just one story .
but let 's take the idea further .
you can bring it to asia .
now take it to the last step .
so i really consider myself a storyteller .
and we define ourselves by our gaps .
and then they also exhibit curiosity .
the next movement is called montage .
the next movement is called mobs .
we can also get a gender breakdown .
other views are also available .
the final movement is called mounds .
it 's a bit different from the others .
" i feel very lonely . "
perse@@ us flying to the rescue of andromeda .
what are the great stories of today ?
nobody 's seen this yet , publicly .
we can have his constellations emerge here .
and then we can also see a timeline .
here we have our secrets .
a trans@@ disciplinary study of cooperation ?
this is a modest little app .
they have n't given up on government .
so scott gets this call .
now we did n't write this app .
how do i get this removed ? "
so scott was speaking person-to-person .
opossum ? check . living ? yep .
good@@ night sweet opossum . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- pretty simple .
it connected those two people .
have you seen these guys ?
this is ti@@ an@@ an@@ men square .
david : ambition to be a doctor .
they said , " let 's march . "
we should be marching towards a global society .
i went in to see her .
she knew it was a hallucination .
she had no control over them .
and you have charles bonnet syndrome .
you have charles bonnet syndrome . "
i work in old-@@ age homes , largely .
his grandfather had these hallucinations .
he 'd had catar@@ act surgery .
his vision was pretty poor .
and you start to see things .
you 're at a particular road junction .
and you 're waiting for your girl .
the charles bonnet ones are quite different .
i had to bring it in .
and now it 's in there somewhere .
suddenly this , and suddenly that .
think of the number of blind people .
and i see the geometrical hallucinations .
thank you so much for sharing .
os : thank you . thank you .
as a child , i had two passions .
one was a passion for rodents .
africa was truly fascinating for me .
we 're talking ' 95 now .
why would you choose rats ?
there 's a target somewhere here .
there , the animal finds a mine .
it scratches on the soil .
very sustainable in this environment .
here , the animal gets its food reward .
and that 's how it works .
now why would you use rats ?
they 're extremely sensitive to smell .
now how do we communicate with rats ?
this consists of 400 square meters .
you have a cassette with 10 samples .
here it 's already at the third sample .
this is a positive sample .
but let 's stick first to tuberculosis .
so this is really considerable .
so , to standardi@@ ze this .
this is in a prototype stage .
there was a reason for everything .
you wo n't discover anything .
and then we have intentions .
i got these hints everywhere .
and you are noticing it more often .
this leads to this question .
and that goes into the story , too .
what is the nature of accidents ?
responsibility was assigned to the family .
and how do i create my own life ?
think about episodes that happened live on radio .
so this whole project was an experiment .
when this woman falls to her death .
it was also twitter as a production mechanism .
keep in mind , they 're all democrats .
and they engage with the real world .
i double checked the newspapers .
is this the end of my dance ? "
but it was n't easy .
but i needed something else .
my story is the power of choice .
it 's the power of an image .
you see some incredible stuff .
first one is really a question of origins .
when did we originate as a species ?
what do i mean by that ?
you 're looking at a great example here .
you think you 've got a tough job ?
and he did a pretty good job .
but based on what data ?
who were these people who came before ?
now , a quick primer on dna .
now multiply it by 100 .
and imagine copying that by hand .
what 's the take-home message ?
so the whole world was drying out .
look at some stone tools .
the population size started to expand .
these would have been savannah hunters .
what do you want to do next ? "
the project launched in april 2005 .
in this case , you actually can .
but i know where she was .
she was with me on my life@@ boat .
i was told i was dyslexic .
in fact , i have got qualifications .
maybe i could become a filmmaker .
because it 's obviously incredibly frightening .
so obviously we did n't have any money .
i was living at my mom 's place .
he was a prisoner of war .
so he was like my hero .
and i remember the first letter .
so anyway , we began the journey .
and we were listening to everybody .
and working with ngos and building this case .
that was an incredible moment .
and we have to make this day work .
children can lead their projects .
that 's what i 'd heard .
i wo n't go into that .
it 'd be really interesting if you came .
it would help and bring attention .
and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
we will observe this day .
we see it as a window of opportunity .
and we gave the film over .
they were saying they would stop .
we have to go for a global truce .
that 's exactly what we must do .
and you can see the education box there .
we 'll utilize sport and football .
and ultimately , we have to try that .
he 's an amazing man .
i said , " what would you do ?
it 's all about the individuals .
it 's all about you and me .
it 's all about partnerships .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thanks a lot .
so why does this matter ?
so let 's start with the data .
they have this very continuous feedback loop .
real-time data turns on the lights .
well , it 's aspirational .
but they locali@@ ze it .
and i think that 's a mistake .
they sometimes store grain in it .
well , you work with the community .
and it works - look at these headlines .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i 'm not kidding .
but more importantly , it saves lives .
they 're waiting to be circumci@@ sed .
well how did that happen ?
let 's look at a country like india .
so what 's the endgame ?
and we are so close .
and this victory is so possible .
to me , that is deep happiness .
this first project is called the allo@@ brain .
they 're mining blood density levels .
you view the bond in the triangle .
this is actually a light emitter .
i 'm usually introduced as a polar explorer .
many of you will know the story .
well , this is n't exactly true .
not quite the whole truth . anyway .
this is where it gets weird .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- yeah , i know !
but there 's a problem .
i live and work from tokyo , japan .
of that stuff , what do you carry ?
it 's kind of like stalking with permission .
ok , that 's fair enough .
and they value that connectivity .
i think , quite a nice feature .
let me give you another example of delegation .
and it works like this .
this is just street@@ -up innovation .
they 'll give you a new one .
they also write them in hindi .
you can subscribe to these .
this is how it 's shifting .
and this is from delhi .
and there are four things .
and we need to learn how to listen .
and why do i say it ?
then hear this , please .
now global warming was un@@ foreseen .
this evidence is overwhelming at this point .
but back to animals and junk food .
what do they have in common ?
incredible , is n't it ?
that 's our number . 10 billion .
that 's just the united states .
they both get it wrong , though .
a hundred years ago , guess what ?
margar@@ ine did n't exist .
and fancy food was entirely french .
vitamins had not been invented .
well , they kept them alive .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it was n't all bad .
many people became fat-@@ phobic .
think of the frozen chicken nugget .
let me pose you a question .
now here is where we all meet .
we need to start acting .
we have to choose that path .
i have a monthly puzzle calendar .
i thought this was a great assignment .
yeah , a lot of you got it .
oh yeah . so , clever thing .
you know , they might have a solution .
you can create one out of legos .
i consider that puzzles are an art form .
the background to one is the other .
it 's all " figure . "
each letter here is one of these digits .
it 's the same this way .
this appears in my puzzle calendar .
and so i think a lot about interaction .
and here it is , figure-ground .
i 'll just go one step further .
there is a game called rush hour .
you know ? what do you do here ?
the first move is going to be what ?
i wanted to make a sequel .
now i 'm making it available to schools .
but it takes some persistence .
which way will these fall ?
gets you thinking about color .
and what does this add up to ?
here is what we see coming .
and we decided to combine our skills .
and we have 24 seconds each .
i 'll play as fast as i can .
that 's the corner of the whole thing .
and sometimes we make real plans .
and sometimes we just start building .
all materials are available for use .
and technology was going to carry us along .
you needed to know that .
i think it adds a huge amount .
happy little story , is n't it ?
it 's a fond memory of times past .
this is the word side of my brain .
so magic is a very introverted field .
that 's true even amongst peers .
-lrb- music -rrb- give it another try .
-lrb- applause -rrb- -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
so they kill the lions .
so i had an idea .
so i set up everything .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- -lrb- applause -rrb- thanks .
one of them was this grandmother .
and i said , " yes . "
and here i am today .
what 's the next one on your list ?
this box contains one billion people .
they are now buying cars .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so there they are .
what about the poorest two billion here ?
the colors show the continent .
look , bangladesh catching up with india .
and the population will double in one generation .
child survival is the new green .
but it 's a very important role .
do it well and get used to it .
but it was a little bit boring .
and this was a cause for celebration .
the art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
so how do you survive ?
you want a dirty magazine ?
come on , raise your hands .
now , how about your household energy use ?
this week ? last week ?
another group got an environmental message .
so what does this tell us ?
in fact , it already is .
and we 're not burning anything .
which brings us back to harriet .
now i 'm here with a genuine expert .
mi@@ wa mat@@ rey@@ ek !
we intuit other people 's feelings .
we are social to the core .
and for them , autism was devastating .
they had profound intellectual disabilities .
they orient to the caregiver .
the caregiver seeks the baby .
there are those individuals who talk too much .
so this is our view of autism .
it 's something very different .
that 's not the idea .
we want them to be free of that .
now , here 's the bad news .
our children sense we 're out of control .
so how can we change this dynamic ?
eighty-@@ three percent of projects failed .
they do things in small chunks .
nothing takes longer than two weeks .
you succeed or fail quickly .
and he made a check@@ mark .
what worked well this week ?
our kids love this process .
so what did we learn ?
i 'm proposing three planks .
plank number one : adapt all the time .
parents can learn a lot from that .
the conversation will go better . "
plank number two : empower your children .
enlist the children in their own upbringing .
so we kind of liked that .
now give us a punishment . okay .
there 's plenty of parental authority going on .
plank number three : tell your story .
we had a pajam@@ a party .
my wife bought a flip chart .
and we ended up with 10 statements .
do you know where your grandparents were born ?
the answer , i believe , is yes .
it 's a matter of choice .
we 've questioned the financial industry .
we 've looked at our government oversight .
we 've questioned where we 're going .
i 'm calling this the great unwind .
commodity prices are like this .
what is your strategy in your household ?
do you know what this was right here ?
this is an absolutely staggering chart .
so this is the first 3@@ 15 billion .
however , consumers have moved .
we 're going to explain that right now .
a couple things that are kind of cool .
and i 'll give you a few examples .
microsoft is doing something wonderful .
we also see a big diy movement .
perfect example of that is patagonia .
another great example is fidelity .
or the interesting company sun@@ run .
it 's incredibly important right now .
the artisanal movement is huge .
also this rise of local currencies .
you actually need to organize it .
a phenomenal blog that 's been built up .
it 's been tremendously powerful for consumers .
i played a lot of chess .
so , he has four kids , right ?
but there 's a middle ground , too .
in that sense , yes .
comics presents a kind of temporal map .
this was even before the web .
parallel narratives could be literally parallel .
x , y and also z.
and notice what 's going on here .
talk about your infinite canvas .
thank you for having me .
i was fortunate in finding things .
then i just pick things up .
so it was pretty interesting stuff .
you all know the story , right .
and everybody 's happy about that .
so that 's what we 've done .
so she sampled some material out of it .
and that was really cool .
and we did find a lot of stuff .
but there was something left .
there were blood vessels left .
and we did . we got better material .
avian dinosaurs are our modern birds .
the chicken is a dinosaur .
" fix the chicken . "
we 'll call them biological modification tools .
and we know selection works .
we also have trans@@ genesis .
and that 's pretty cool .
but there 's another thing .
this is a chicken with teeth .
now that 's a good characteristic .
we can save that one .
we know we can use that .
we can make a chicken with teeth .
and the same goes for the tails .
but it 's just the very basics .
so that really is what we 're doing .
what good is it ? "
well , that 's a good question .
it 's a demonstration of augmented reality .
and keep your eyes on the big screen .
augmented reality is just the latest technology .
now many of them are intensely dramatic .
the tricks of magic have one special element .
it 's fun to be fooled .
we feel compelled to tell them .
they want to share the experience .
we think in narrative structures .
it 's a uniquely human achievement .
i just become sk@@ an@@ ky .
and i 'm already off-@@ message .
we bring stories to the public .
they all need a face .
but you do n't do this . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and they deserve better .
we 're in the middle of the process .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i miss michael .
well , they used it .
no , that is not me .
i was so wasted . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's a responsibility .
a book cover is a distillation .
this story was a real puzzle .
this is what it 's about .
he will not be pleased .
try experiencing that on a kindle .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- do n't get me started .
so how do we show this ?
she was the only mother in the group .
the others were brothers , sisters .
i suffered a lot as a mother .
but she knows where he is .
but we were all so nervous .
what did we want from each other ?
because our time is up .
you have to fight against violence .
this is what i wanted to say .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- the microbes that cover us .
they 're microbes . they 're tiny .
we are them . they are us .
about 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories .
the mola 's no exception .
molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites .
we 'd love to tag in monterey .
well , not the one we tagged !
and that 's kind of their home range .
so i create these two poles .
this process costs 60,000 dollars .
i do take certain liberties and intervene .
it 's called the world church of god .
and i put them into my photograph .
it 's titled " the inno@@ cents . "
that 's it . thank you .
it 's called the basket cell .
new ones are being discovered everyday .
so these molecules are called channel@@ rho@@ dopsins .
so this is very powerful .
and so that 's what happens .
now we can generalize the idea .
this goes back to the pavlo@@ vian days .
this tone used to mean bad news .
okay , there it goes . right now .
now how could you repair this ?
so how are we going to solve this ?
light is converted to electricity on them .
ed boy@@ den : that 's right .
eb : right , yeah .
from there i started with skydiving .
you need to have the best possible equipment .
i think we all might have some questions .
jc : coming off of you ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- ue : hopefully not .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- jc : that seems dangerous .
they were around me in three directions .
they come to respect him .
let 's get it all online . "
she 's the one who feeds me .
that 's when language begins .
i was not a great student .
and educate yourself as you go along .
and that 's the key to success .
and i also had this extended network .
they kept us in play .
we 're investing in our future .
we are a nation of immigrants .
but i gotta have my hot dog .
and the scene repeats itself so often .
they 've changed the world .
and it 's a pretty big building .
this is five times larger .
right ? it 's pretty big .
and every single one of these companies denies .
yet we have these files .
instead , they 've been hacked .
let 's take , for example , sweden .
and then we turn it around .
so this is not balanced .
like , skype used to be secure .
it used to be end-to-end encrypted .
today , it no longer is secure .
it 's the war on terror .
you should n't worry about it .
and i have nothing to hide .
that 's what it 's about .
the solution is open source .
-lrb- applause -rrb- the substance of things unseen .
cities , past and future .
so , act i : a map found .
what 's that palm tree doing there ?
and it 's this map you see here .
we can calculate the aspect .
where do they get their food ?
where do they get their reproductive resources ?
so we just started making a list .
but you can also talk about sunny places .
or fire . or dry soils .
maybe a timber ratt@@ le@@ snake lived there .
and then we took this data .
now this took place in january of 2002 .
she does n't know she 's being filmed .
she 's being filmed with a hidden camera .
it 's about 30 degrees outside .
one person 's not that unusual .
this goes on for another four stops .
you 'll see that start right here .
there were several other activities .
there 's a better photo of it .
so again , this is 2005 .
so a very diverse group of people .
but also , do n't shop .
everybody else is one of our actors .
you can see them in this footage .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
it 's morning rush hour .
it 's very cold outside .
and of course they do n't .
we do n't need a reason .
i still paint . i love art .
" but why ? " i asked him .
" come on , man ! what policemen ?
and this was not a misplaced feeling .
i tweet . i love it .
we can all change the world .
so , welcome to the golden desert .
and this is all big raised platform .
and then it is 40 feet deep .
they collect 100 thousand liters in one season .
and this is pure drinking water .
we often use a term called by@@ laws .
you can calculate the price of that water .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and we request them .
and this is the 16 centimeter area .
you wo n't find water in this slide .
this was for mass communication .
and perhaps they knew the future also .
but this is not ground water .
but this is no ordinary well .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- how they maintain them ?
this was done in 11th century .
this tire comes from the airplane .
they were using it on their body .
so , this is the message of desert .
or is this just right for this place ?
one recharge , and one stores .
so , it depends on the terrain .
otherwise , it ca n't be done .
it applies equally to math .
i believe in real life .
so i hope you can see .
that 's all we 're doing here .
so now we have a water tank .
so now we have the real deal .
this has been a lot of fun .
math makes sense of the world .
that 's europe . " but , yeah .
in which many companies instead fail .
this monster with big tentacles .
leave the rest to the revolution@@ aries . "
who 's actually funding the hard stuff ?
the private sector does a lot .
you will fail when you innovative .
one out of 10 experiments has any success .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- what is this ?
you 've won a prize !
so , where are they from ?
they are more american than anything else .
he 's in taiwan right now .
i went to his home town .
and i went looking for chicken .
she 's like , " it 's not ?
and this is how we look for them .
and the rift valley is a depression .
where did these things come from ?
i think it 's our collective intelligence .
i mean , these are extraordinary numbers .
we all have an african origin .
i 'm not quite sure .
here , i 'll show it to you .
and those bits are words .
well , i blame the queen .
computers ! what about computers ?
they do n't change the end result .
the design has not changed .
online dictionaries must be different .
we have a pan that 's too small !
some of my best friends are books .
and i think this is a problem .
being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction .
you can ask for help !
there 's a lot going on there .
tiny , little word , 33 numbered definitions .
do you know what that says to me ?
we 're missing california from american english .
he 's found more than 140 comets .
but he found 140 comets without a telescope .
what newspaper was it in ? what book ?
we can put in all the meanings .
this is what dictionaries used to look like .
thank you very much for your kind attention .
there are natural biological materials .
these proteins are very negatively charged .
and so here 's the periodic table .
and i absolutely love the periodic table .
and this is pretty easy biotechnology .
my students promised me it would work .
the last example are solar cells .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so this is one .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- another new york project .
you do n't see the horizon .
he 's from korea originally .
so i just picked another one .
and this was two weeks ago .
this is from the front .
then it 's : " guts . "
next step in my process .
in fact , this technology 's been evolving .
i have a global vision for vision .
you start to get into detail .
how do you deal with the industry ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- i 'm a filmmaker .
but i think the girls could do it .
chanting : one united nation .
fat@@ ah , hamas and the popular front !
there is no need to use violence .
but that 's true for adults too .
so we organized a screening .
and that gap continues to widen .
but the world is n't second life .
we can be astonishingly inventive and creative .
so how does this transition idea work ?
that 's what spreads hiv . "
well , one or two brave souls .
one in four , maximum .
this is a really easy problem .
for once , your incentives are aligned .
so she was making a politically rational decision .
so , completely irrational , you would think .
are we any more rational about sex ?
here , maybe you 'll have better luck .
let 's just stop treating people . "
so these are data from scotland .
this is of new infections .
is that what 's happening ?
why does she do that job ?
so why is this important ?
i mean , that 's 2005 figures .
they 're the other big generation .
it no longer just makes sense .
it turns out , all sorts of things .
it 's keeping the lights on .
sometimes , it 's all at once .
transit is a big driver of retrofits .
so here 's what it looks like .
by 1995 , the mall has died .
they 're easy to be re-@@ adapted .
but the one story stuff ...
so here it is at projected buil@@ d-out .
it 's about two-thirds built out right now .
we need to also retrofit the corridors themselves .
this is another re-greening example .
where should we be re@@ developing ?
the final challenge is for all of you .
we talk about things in relative terms .
the reality is really , very different .
one , on average , comes from europe .
100 come from asia and the pacific .
and let 's look at another map .
and it 's the same with nurses .
have a seat . you 're safe here .
your baby is going to be hiv-negative . "
so often the men are gone .
our organization has three goals .
disclosure is so central to prevention .
we also work in groups .
and it 's important about disclosure .
and you see where this is going .
our organization works on three levels .
they become leaders within their communities .
we have to do that .
our health care systems are broken .
each person must know their hiv status .
and that 's what i came up with .
supermarkets are an easy place to start .
it 's called sheep 's organs .
who keeps lettuces in their fridge ?
they are our family . "
they would offer sweets or money .
that 's what the celebration is all about .
so , we sucked up .
we 're all strands in it .
talk about a picture of compassion .
arm in arm for struggle .
you heard about riots all across the land .
i know how you feel . "
how do you make it real ?
compassion takes on a corporate dynamic .
we are one people together .
this is a season of grace .
unusual things are beginning to happen .
and this is why we do it .
they go shopping for all sorts of things .
and the big day comes .
and researchers want to know why .
what can we learn from them ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- obvious , right .
for example , the happy wife .
but here 's what 's going on here .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i 'm serious .
they actually call it the oscar curse .
and we do like a cocktail or two .
i 'll see you at the bar .
it was called the human powered computer experiment .
it 's a room broken in two halves .
you see this little pattern here ?
free bold feels like mandela free .
this was a square that responds to sound .
thank you . -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
and why do we have this facility ?
we are n't functioning so easily anymore .
we are n't a simple authoritarian regime anymore .
i was born in 1976 .
i grew up in a traditional mexican family .
we have a big problem .
we are a country of victims .
we were victims of the spani@@ ards .
then we were victims of the french .
then we were victims of the pr@@ i .
and of el pe@@ je .
hold on ! wait a minute !
and we 're acting out of that fear .
we need to confront this fear .
we go from fear to courage .
let 's do something about it . "
now we 're experiencing one every week .
of course , criminals can respond .
they just have to raise their hands .
what are we going to do ?
where is the soldier in each son ?
we 're facing a very powerful opponent .
but we are many more .
they can take a man 's life .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
huh . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- solar technology is ...
oh , that 's all my time ?
i will do exactly as i 'm told .
there 's nothing too difficult about the piece .
and i 'm being told the dynamic .
snares on , snares off .
however , that is simply not enough .
and i 'm doing far , far less .
not just translate them , but interpret them .
and i just could n't quite accept that .
i have the sound coming this way .
do you see what i mean ?
and this is quite interesting .
those are hugely important aspects to think about .
see , you 're awake .
rain . not bad . not bad .
and that 's exactly what he did .
we had to study from study books .
you know . i need to say something .
they 're experiencing that rawness there .
but thank you very much for having me !
a fantastically viral and wonderful video .
it included an exterior loading dock .
the machine itself would start the music .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- -lrb- applause -rrb- okay .
the machine itself has 89 distinct interactions .
and it 's actually in the machine .
what else ? planning is incredibly important .
again , small to large is relevant here .
tim 's sun@@ dial hat .
or was venus extremely hot ?
and more co2 causes more warming .
the physics does not change .
there would be no stable shoreline .
the economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
global warming is already affecting people .
more grandchildren helped me along .
sounds like a conservative climate plan . "
but we are n't even starting .
an elderly , white-@@ haired man stands up .
what were scientists called before ?
that 's the heroic part of their story .
there 's a flip side as well .
now this is important for two reasons .
woman : an olive server .
steve jur@@ ve@@ t@@ son : steve .
right there . that 's great .
s@@ j : it 's cold .
s@@ j : excellent , thank you .
we have a video to show you .
new milk carton : i 'm new milk .
-lrb- applause -rrb- let 's talk dirty .
and here 's another image of diarrhea .
and that 's her dad .
these are cholera beds in haiti .
but we know how to fix this .
poop 's not particularly adequate .
no one 's going to refuse clean water .
poop can cook your dinner .
it 's got nutrients in it .
we do n't keep them all .
she 's been suffering for years .
maybe it 's the ick factor .
so the idea is to manipulate human emotion .
she 'd grown up with a latrine .
they 've made it conversational .
people go out and upgrade their toilet .
things are going wrong here too .
can you turn off the light ? down .
i like to be in the dark .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- this is in venice .
and we continue to work with this client .
so , it was an accidental discovery .
i did this building in japan .
this was built in six months .
i played with it in the evening .
we 've been friends for a long time .
he was the swiss army knife .
p for pal@@ ladi@@ o .
i had nothing to do with it .
and i 'm always drawn to that .
and that chain link is really expensive .
it 's in perspective and everything .
it made my building look sick .
it led to the building on the left .
i just tell the stories .
it 's copper and galvanize .
this is the central area .
and so stanley did the little dome thing .
i do n't want the tower . "
and the shape fit perfectly .
i just joined the points .
this is a small house somewhere .
it 's in the west valley .
you 've got the idea .
and so we finally ended up making it .
these people are art collectors .
i keep trying to make it work .
it 's never been finished .
there 's a railroad track .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- you drive down .
and this would be a hotel .
it 's hard to do high-rise .
and that 's it , built .
and it 's very private .
these are n't focused very well .
focus the one on the right .
left - it 's my right .
this is for michael eisner - disney .
kind of a fun thing to do .
they call it the plan cou@@ pe .
and it faces into a park .
i do n't know what to do .
and it 's got a fish .
it 's like a drug addict .
and then i do it .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- there it is .
but it 's the living room .
this is a shopping thing .
it 's plaster and just zinc .
so it 's pretty quiet inside .
it 's a complicated project .
it has a chamber hall .
there 's commercial at the ground floor .
and we studied many models .
this was our original model .
i just stuck it on there .
larry hal@@ pr@@ in is doing the stairs .
and we split these bridges .
i want to talk about the election .
one exception is in massachusetts .
that was john kerry 's home state .
here is the same data on a map .
so we have to ask why .
is racism predictable in some way ?
so yes , racism is predictable .
there is a big difference .
it 's whatever moves you personally .
beethoven is adored in japan .
how can we explain this universality ?
it 's quite a familiar story .
he actually used that word .
no , i do n't think it is .
what were these artifacts for ?
one is called the general election .
the other is called the lester election .
and here 's the trick .
okay . that 's lesterland .
number one , the united states is lesterland .
but you must do extremely well .
now you say , really ?
so here 's the model of government .
so the right wants smaller government .
but here 's the bad news .
but we can not ignore this corruption anymore .
there will never be a christmas .
okay . so how do we do it ?
the analy@@ tics are easy here .
but i do n't buy it .
this is a solvable issue .
what is that sense of hopelessness ? "
nothing you can do . "
so would i do nothing ?
i 'm going off to build google glass .
do you have that love ?
a republic . a representative democracy .
a government dependent upon the people alone .
we have lost that republic .
so that 's another project for nasa .
that looks like a coastline .
well , most of you anyway .
it may change this century .
it 's new in our history .
but they will have a dark side .
the continental land@@ masses drifted around .
ice cover waxed and wan@@ ed .
this sign@@ aled the start of agriculture .
it 's about a tenth of a millimeter .
that 's how small that is .
you have things like coral .
they 're like a snapshot in time .
but mostly i 'm entran@@ ced by it .
-lrb- gasps -rrb- oops . sorry .
it 's got a chin bar@@ bel .
the light organs under the eyes are flashing .
that chin bar@@ bel is flashing .
this blinds or distr@@ acts the predator .
they 're things like this .
and you see things like this .
and these are fly@@ trap ane@@ mon@@ es .
it 's a green saber of light .
we call it the electronic jellyfish .
so the camera 's black and white .
there 's something small there that responds .
we 're talking to something .
we do n't know what we 're saying .
and this is a burglar alarm .
this guy is a little more contemplative .
" hey , wait a minute .
i 've talked for three minutes .
but let 's suppose we did this .
so that 's the first big problem .
existential risk - the second big problem .
so that 's a large number .
you just want to cling onto this .
is this the best we can do ?
human nature would have to change .
it 's a pretty pathetic list .
these are really great things .
con@@ scienti@@ ousness and sympathy .
it 's been done in vol@@ es .
it 's just a single gene .
and there were a few .
this was a life as a craftsman .
autonomy was our highest value .
we ca n't cure it all .
but what does it take ?
we ca n't do it all by ourselves .
everyone just has a piece of the care .
that would be really our only choice .
it 's not a system .
and he wanted to get the data .
it took him three months .
they had found a problem .
skill one , find where your failures are .
skill two is devise solutions .
could we design a checklist for surgery ?
this was bigger than a drug .
and it 's been slow to spread .
so this is a computer program .
there are other questions like this , too .
they 're no good either .
and here 's how we do it .
this is part of that genome .
it feels the dna origami .
it 's china , right ?
that 's really not affordable .
and we started a studio .
the letter c had other things in it .
i happen to know it for a fact .
too many po@@ gro@@ ms .
well , not so awful .
there 's con@@ sol@@ ing .
how do we know when we are ourselves ?
i 'm going to quickly go through this .
oh my god , you know what ?
and then i go and have some tea .
i 'll come back to that later .
nobody has claimed credit for that .
but so what we need is a plan b.
it 's not that hard a problem .
eighty-@@ two dollars a night .
eighty-@@ two dollars a night .
take the way we fight our wars .
for two reasons , i think .
that 's one reason to worry .
they 've tried this , actually .
what would be your reason ?
who will get our discussion started ? yes ?
all right , what about that ?
it will work the same either way .
our children go to different schools .
does anybody know what he was looking for ?
and they 're aimed at protecting the relationships .
our relationship is still important .
here 's one of his best@@ selling books .
i can assure you there 's deception there .
those are the conversations that really matter .
a lot of humans have lived since then .
all right . very good . about half .
all right . slightly more for b.
excellent . here 's the answer .
since then , they publish every year .
now i found this principle really exciting .
that 's exciting in itself .
but physicians have another characteristic .
this is the u.k. government spend .
that funds everything in the u.k.
so it is n't in the series .
what 's fascinating and beautiful ...
it 's a beautiful graphic .
that 's one more picture of enceladus .
this is when cassini flew beneath enceladus .
earth@@ rise from apollo 8 .
so exploration can pay for itself .
that 's quite an incredible prediction .
well , this is a picture of it .
it was taken by the cassini space probe .
the voyager is a tiny machine .
surely , we know enough .
so here 's what i came up with .
why are we talking about microalgae ?
some cities just release the water .
and what about operating costs ?
and what about capital costs ?
where else could we potentially put this system ?
there 's lots of possibilities .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
but the reality is far from it .
and this video is real time .
bugs bunny is my muse .
so let us start with the first one .
-lrb- video -rrb- narration : " budapest . "
i lived in new york city .
and we would visit each other .
it 's called " the country . "
who could sleep that night ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- bc : thank you .
and it 's addressed to a certain person .
you 're loved for just being you .
the sun burns our peripheral vision .
we see light reflected off the moon .
we ca n't see them directly .
they destroy stars around them .
they churn up debris in their surroundings .
these are the natural curves in space .
it 's actually not massive enough .
this was one of the groups .
you would literally hear the sound .
-lrb- thu@@ mping -rrb- then it 's gone .
this is another sound from my group .
both black holes are moving .
both black holes are getting closer together .
-lrb- thu@@ mping -rrb- now it 's gone .
it might make a sound .
we were n't even here .
it 's like hurry , build your instruments .
-lrb- static -rrb- it 's a terrible sound .
it 's literally the definition of noise .
here 's my multiverse creatures .
and it finally happened , so ...
pr : we have n't prepared anything .
i had this irrational fear .
there were like 20 people there .
i mean , it 's a nightmare .
and that 's when i had an epiphany .
it 's actually very hot .
and this is air temperature .
but what does it mean ?
and how do we do that ?
we do n't borrow any energy from history .
we are not using fossil energies .
and these beautiful umbrel@@ las .
they measure very , very carefully .
i 'll talk about that a little bit .
now let 's go to young children .
so they had created these artifacts .
so that 's what lauren did .
well , that 's pretty amazing .
see the car turn by five here ?
make it go in the other direction .
and we 'll call this a wheel .
what do i get there ? "
student 1 : ooh , this is nice .
student 3@@ :@@ 0.@@ 99 seconds .
teacher : drop . class : whoa !
we 've done that already . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- one more .
who here thought of a bat ?
now flight is an inherently difficult thing .
most bats look like the previous one .
this is considered the five blessings .
bats are also threatened in the u.s.
now how can this help us ?
nobody ? one ? how about 10 years ?
some ? how about 30 ?
but what would be so amazing about this ?
this is him on the screen .
this is the story of my brother .
and those questions all have variables to them .
all of our stat@@ uses are different .
here is an m.@@ s. patient .
these are why people pray .
so , you can see the duration .
all open , all available .
and this is my brother 's profile .
wait , poor spinal capacity .
this is about the patients .
and here 's another paper .
and they call the internet irresponsible .
here 's the implication of what happens .
you know , a data network .
this is not just graphics .
and it works almost every time .
but almost all the time it works .
it 's the intent to treat curve .
it only works about 12 months .
we 'll do some side-by-side comparisons here .
this one 's more about the ly@@ ric .
" the worlds are the important thing .
2007 . the iphone makes it debut .
it 's the same animal , at least .
now , can someone own this idea ?
and the sum looks like this .
i was awakened once during the night .
it tracks your movement through space .
this tracks your activity and also your sleep .
what should it be for ?
the world is fuc@@ ked up .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- except maybe french people .
" oh , all right . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- " that 's cool . "
could art change the world ?
i started when i was 15 years old .
i was quite proud of that one .
we called the project face 2 face .
the experts said , " no way .
the people will not accept .
okay , for example , that 's palestine .
we 're in ra@@ mal@@ lah right now .
they are not meant to stay .
i called that project women are heroes .
so i decided to go there .
we 're hungry for culture .
we need culture out there . "
you see that enough in the media .
everyone there understood the project .
i mean , you should see that .
art . just doing art .
and then it becomes more .
so the people kept it .
of course , they were confused .
for each project we do a film .
behind each image is a story .
you understand the full scope of the project .
art can create an analogy .
they would be really useful . "
or , " how can we help ? "
yes , everyone in the room .
what we see changes who we are .
so we start by brewing the tea .
so this is my mini fabric farm .
and this is a static culture .
it does n't need light .
at this point , it 's really heavy .
align it in this direction .
sl : yes , it is .
let me tell you where i got it .
the bee is not calling the shots .
the competition of grasses , right ?
and suddenly everything looked different .
and that 's what the lawn was .
well , we 're all equally sophisticated .
they graze everything down , intensive grazing .
very useful second ecosystem service .
so , it 's a very productive system .
this is how soil is created .
it 's created from the bottom up .
more for us , less for nature .
it 's a remarkably hopeful thing to do .
you can see my grandmother there .
other companies have sustainability strategies .
but first , let 's think of customers .
we will go all in .
it 's a brilliant textile in use .
it 's really dirty in production .
again , we 're going all-@@ in .
that 's about the size of germany .
so be decisive on these issues .
but then it comes to your operations .
some things are certain , i think .
and why not take control of it ourselves ?
but think of a solar panel .
every business can do things like this .
be a discer@@ ning consumer .
i would watch nova on pbs .
it 's actually pretty busy .
so now we 've gone back in time .
we 're now riding along with voyager 1 .
it actually flies underneath saturn .
you can manipulate it yourself .
your sequence and mine are slightly different .
are you more than your genes ?
-lrb- audience : yes . -rrb- yes ?
i think we should make a statement .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i am my connectome .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- right . all together now .
everybody : i am my connectome .
ss : that sounded great .
that 's a lot of information .
what 's in that information ?
so you see how to find a synapse .
how can we find an entire connectome ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- but may i ?
what kinds of changes happen ?
well , it 's true .
these signals are called neural activity .
what 's in this picture ?
what else is in this picture ?
neural activity is constantly changing .
they 're going to be scra@@ mbled up .
philosophers know this game very well .
what would you do today ?
that 's the part that works .
that 's the part that 's broken .
we call it matter@@ net .
we use three key technologies .
the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
first of all , the u@@ av@@ s .
this is the key to the technology .
costs are coming down very rapidly .
half a billion of us live in megacities .
so why are we doing this ?
we call it patient capital .
they use mobutu as metaphor .
third , they are often creating markets .
and he used three fundamental principles .
the first one was miniaturization .
second , it had to be extremely affordable .
this idea of scale is critical .
but that 's obviously not enough .
i would say that the converse is true .
it was about 1@@ 15 degrees .
because he was building these crops .
volan@@ tor@@ -like helicopter , perhaps .
on the ground , it 's powered electrically .
and it 's been a great motivator .
how would a trip in a skycar work ?
but it 's still fairly quiet .
we have eight engines in this vehicle .
redundancy is the critical issue here .
if you stick around , then good luck .
there wo n't be a third chance .
and it is really fun to say .
you can use it at ted .
i did n't know it .
famous for its diversity , human diversity .
but not when they 're together like that .
you can come back to earth .
you can finish your game .
i did n't know that .
and this is feli@@ x , actually .
here , he 's bringing the sun out .
video : the sun is rising .
video : the orange tractor .
dm : inventing his own narrative .
video : fly away , cat .
now i put a bass line in .
how have we not made the connection ?
you were appointed a social worker .
the adop@@ tive parents were lined up .
so the adoption papers were signed .
i was norman mark green@@ wood .
i have to tell this story .
it gives you reference points .
in creativity i saw light .
and it 's this machine .
and of course it 's born stupid .
infants do n't respond to much .
this brain is very much a thinking machine .
this is actually very powerful .
so here is a very simple experiment .
each attempt was substantially different from the other .
but the monkey gradually developed a strategy .
and we see that it 's distorted .
monkey has like you have .
this is constructed by physical change .
or acquiring their native language abilities .
it 's what 's rewarding to you .
and that underlies your specialization .
and the brain specializes for it .
it creates a representation of language crap .
and then the child is stuck with it .
it can also happen in the brain .
this is from about 3,000 children .
this is a substantially large impact .
noise is increasing in the brain .
i 'm thrilled to be here .
so that 's kind of a bold statement .
i 'll tell you a little bit more .
it actually gets re@@ integrated in the body .
and the material looks something like this .
so this material is silk .
and so we get this starting material .
they find their way to self-assemble .
and so what does that mean ?
it 's actually not limited to films .
but you can do other things .
and you can think of different formats .
you can do bigger things .
and the gears work in water as well .
so you think of alternative mechanical parts .
but there are still some unique traits .
we can deflect both of these asteroids .
these problems are both technically solvable .
we love to circle around things .
because actually , we do face this situation .
this is where we are as a country .
so here 's another asteroid .
whites are headed that way too .
how many of you can see all four ?
okay , almost all of you .
but are conservatives happy about this ?
now what could this mean ?
so what could this mean ?
we can download new diagnostics .
say a new super bug has emerged .
beam me up , scot@@ ty .
it meant a connection to the world .
scott 's results were full of them .
and he had a lump of iron .
and he became interested in that .
so , he had a brilliant idea .
and we see the mother in every being .
you can feel the familiarity of all beings .
this is not regenerative medicine .
and this is just the same .
we 've come a long way since then .
it 's a wild concept .
the first is cellular therapies .
secondly , we can use materials .
and he asked a very important question .
this is the reality of diabetes .
that material contained only natural signals .
after treatment that 's what it looks like .
this is clinically relevant today .
but could you go a little further ?
it 's the coolest stuff .
but this one 's kind of cool .
you see the cells coming back out .
this was a randomized trial .
these are now two years out .
all done in the lab .
so my 18 minutes is up .
it 's very powerful work .
clearly the images kind of get that across .
the european union , same thing .
we 've had a different approach .
think about your own choices .
here 's their olive oil aisle .
they had 3@@ 48 different kinds of jam .
now we see the opposite effect .
the typical walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
they 're all important choices . "
the third technique : categorization .
here are two different jewelry displays .
okay , a bit more .
now it turns out you 're right .
who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
we have to gradually increase the complexity .
what am i going to look at ?
where 'd that come from ?
why is it that x is the unknown ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- i 'm a garbage man .
think back when you were just a kid .
they have very different densities .
they have different electrical and magnetic properties .
and they even have different colors .
and they extract the metals by hand .
i call this environmental arbit@@ rage .
this is just one example .
they store the plastics on the roofs .
and we eventually broke the code .
this is the last frontier of recycling .
we have enormous energy savings .
our customers get to enjoy huge co2 savings .
and they get to make more sustainable products .
even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
we took our clues from mother nature .
and it 's a wonderful thing .
this is a picture called a cutaway .
and the hope was two-@@ fold .
stea@@ ming ought to be faster .
so here 's another one .
here 's our hamburger cutaway .
but hey , they grow back .
it 's a partial differential equation .
we also did a lot of calculation .
this is the 30-@@ hour hamburger .
we make every aspect of this burger .
so it 's a great illustration of that .
we have a chapter on gels .
what 's pushing on it ?
and this explanation represents great progress .
mystery solved , multiverse found .
now some find this explanation un@@ satisfying .
kepler was asking the wrong question .
but there 's a little secret .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
the different shapes yield different physical features .
bg : well it 's hard to say .
holy cow ! that 's just amazing .
that was his passion for the music .
both my parents really loved it .
and he ran around the bases .
and i thought , go figure .
it 's a language that 's still evolving .
they 're locations in the spectrum of sound .
-lrb- music -rrb- and in the 21st century ...
this was truly the music of the spheres .
ah , wicked , cruel fate !
ah , bal@@ e@@ ful stars !
ah , av@@ ar@@ icious heaven !
now this moment so fascinates me .
i find it such a profound one .
what happens when the music stops ?
where does it go ? what 's left ?
the first of these is informed consent .
they face a cruel situation of no choice .
that 's a huge problem .
older people have that experience .
but it 's just one chemical .
to me , this says three things .
first , do n't become a canni@@ bal .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- just a little .
he eventually won a seat in congress .
so he put the pen down .
his story would be told .
he was a great storyteller .
fabulous , colorful , anecdotal stories .
but they were great , nonetheless .
but it was too late .
it 's not a sin . "
i told the priest right away .
and then came my second sin .
" oh yes , " i said .
i 'm very fortunate to be here .
it 's a true feeling .
and she 's a very high-tech superintendent .
it all started back in 1977 .
it was an experimental education program .
and that question cleared the space .
his name is chris far@@ ina .
but the film has really gone places .
and it 's a beautiful thing .
and i have that kind of flash sometimes .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- you know that teacher ?
i 'm not here alone .
and it has four plexig@@ la@@ ss layers .
there are four countries around the board .
and each country has a cabinet .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's not all .
i 'm just a clock wat@@ cher .
the students run the game .
so i 'll just share with you ...
and so i apologize to them as well .
to her girlfriends she said that .
and we were very upset .
it came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
we have a letter in the game .
he 's been in many battles .
but it 's self-evident assessment .
so i 'll just share a third story .
this is about my friend bren@@ nan .
there was no way they could win .
they should n't be failing like this .
the parents were looking in the window .
and we 've got 600 billion dollars .
and the game is won .
some games are more about warfare .
but you get these resources together .
young and old , dancing in the streets .
you have to have legal structure .
you have to have physical structure .
and that creates additional costs .
you have to exclude some people .
you lose the institutional imperative .
you can follow this in the guardian .
it 's actually quite entertaining .
right ? how do you capture that ?
do you want that patch , right ?
sta@@ y-@@ at-@@ home moms . right ?
i think this is a revolution .
and i use that word advi@@ se@@ dly .
it has de-@@ professionalized publishing .
how will they share ideas and opinions ?
pro-@@ ana , the pro-@@ ana groups .
it takes us from point a to chaos .
and i have a dream .
we have focused on the problems .
this is from a global survey .
these seem to be natural human aspirations .
why are statisticians not measuring these ?
it is an efficiency measure .
it 's about the well-being of nations .
but now for the good news !
this is an aspirational graph .
maybe some of you have .
that is longer than in the usa .
they are the happiest place .
what 's happening in costa rica ?
we can look at some of the data .
they have the social connectedness .
it might be latin american .
that 's what we need to do .
that 's one way of looking at it .
this is not the very distant future .
what would that look like for society ?
and why do i hear that ?
that 's how you create a collective goal .
what are these for happiness ?
the second one is be active .
being active is great for our positive mood .
the third one is take notice .
we feel good if we give .
they do n't have any carbon content .
human beings want to be happy .
pa@@ ve them with the five ways .
politics have defined our lives .
our artists are at risk .
we are in a position of danger .
culture is a form of resistance .
it was after the islamic revolution of 1979 .
for me , this became incredibly important .
my knife became a little sharper .
i am a nomadic artist .
now i am making films .
it 's a magical realist novel .
the green movement significantly inspired the world .
they have confronted the authority .
imagine that you run a cafe .
show us everyone who 's available .
they 're from multiple agencies .
and it 's monitoring their reliability .
they 're likely to be more expensive .
it 's all extremely low overhead .
basically classified adver@@ ts with a search facility .
suppose we stopped taking that for granted .
how do i make that happen ? "
let 's take britain as an example .
and it puts some obligations on those operators .
could we use the same model ?
think of it as a regulated public utility .
so government then exits the frame .
it does n't bother the taxpayer necessarily .
is it worth their while ?
should they be looking at other sectors ?
this kind of data can become routine .
this is a world of atomized capitalism .
does that sound improbable to you ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
and let me show you a simple example .
so here 's another example .
but it does require a lot of planning .
the shores are from a different location .
and here every piece is very well planned .
but you have to have the right tools .
you see that really salty play-doh ?
well , it conducts electricity .
and this is nothing new .
so what does that mean ?
it 's like a wall to the electricity .
i plug in again the power to it .
i can start plugging in lots of lights .
so this is all in your home kitchen .
he was a man of tremendous leadership .
he had the favor of god with him .
now , what causes this ?
the problem is not technology .
what shall i talk to her about ? "
and he surprised me with the answer .
i talk ad li@@ b .
we see people on our screens .
they do n't know that she 's dead .
the old stars , they come to life .
about 300 of them were there .
i 've talked to them .
on the contrary , they 're sisters . "
he said , " so do i. "
i 'm the embodiment of all truth . "
or he was what he claimed to be .
i could n't prove it .
richard wurman : you did it .
how long are you staying ? "
now that statistic is quite shocking .
how did those students get all that knowledge ?
a language dies every 14 days .
could there be a connection ?
well i do n't know .
that is a little bit too early .
well , i do n't think so .
maybe the barrier would be too universal .
it 's all in english . "
it feeds the english requirement .
case in point , einstein .
so immediately , we 're rejecting them .
it 's a circular thing .
it 's an arab@@ ic-@@ medium school .
use it to spread great ideas .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you very much .
we will be an overwhelmingly urban species .
and people are embracing this .
some of it 's transportation access .
buildings are becoming bundles of services .
this is one way to do it .
so we have visions like this .
the wisdom lives inside of them .
they were dressed to the n@@ ines .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- they acted silly .
they really enjoyed each other 's company .
it was a huge success .
he 's even here today .
i grew up in wonder .
i grew up amongst those animals .
ubuntu : i am because of you .
we worked together as a team .
solly remained on the bank .
the croc again continues to shake me .
it goes to bite me a second time .
the meat is torn up .
he comes straight into the channel .
he gets to me . he grabs me .
i 'm still in a vulnerable position .
and bees are very faithful .
we have bumblebees on the top .
and so we need to rethink this idea .
and i encourage you to look at that .
and so i went out .
everybody contributes a little bit .
well , it was the whole city .
and the old one looked like this .
and you can get a list .
and there are all these interesting tools .
so you can do kind of interesting contests .
no , that 's not true .
they 're talking about slavery in 18@@ 60 .
i 'll go very quickly .
now this is a very interesting thing .
i hope it continues here .
my mind was so shattered .
girls are trained to please .
i want to change the verb .
i want us all to change the verb .
she has literally become deputy mayor .
she 's changed the rules .
we will not cut you .
and that is the power of transformation .
and i want to do it for sunitha .
i 'm an emotional creature ! "
i am an emotional creature .
i know when a storm is coming .
i am an emotional creature .
i am an emotional creature .
these feelings make me better .
i am an emotional creature .
there is a particular way of knowing .
it 's like the older women somehow forgot .
i am an emotional creature .
i am an emotional creature .
i am your remaining memory .
i can take you back .
nothing 's been dilu@@ ted .
can you say it with me ?
it is four in the morning . "
there 's a ru@@ mble in my stomach .
marge simpson : homer , please .
well , how could it have ?
what happened to william jefferson clinton ?
we might not ever know .
this was a perfect introduction .
they did n't fit in at the institute .
these were not theoretical physicists .
then they switched to a magnetic drum .
and this is the beginning of computer graphics .
this includes a large amount of human error .
what 's code , what 's hardware ?
burning lots of midnight oil .
so they really were working under tough conditions .
" i have now duplicated both results .
this now is the third different output .
he had a wonderful rapport .
it was published in the literature .
they have to have something .
and they did start to evolve .
and he went around the country after that .
and could you do it again now ?
you know , could we get them running ?
thank you for setting up my display .
i mean , it 's just wonderful .
the acid will ruin the gold plating .
it 's a delight to use .
it 's beautiful and it 's functional .
and those are the three components .
no . but is it fun ?
it 's really simple and subtle .
and it 's just clever .
it 's so much fun to drive . "
it 's round , it 's neat .
intense fear paraly@@ zes you .
but it really changes the way you think .
would you tie those two strings together ? "
you 've got be anxious .
it 's all about the visceral experience .
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it 's being safe in the world .
it looks over what 's going on .
here 's a great reflective product .
but that 's reflective design as well .
this is a clear don norman watch .
so that 's the new me .
now this is a fanciful theory .
what is the average difference here ?
the survey takes over a day .
does this have cumulative effects ?
can we push this data even further ?
smoking is in some deep sense negative savings .
and that 's exactly what we find .
she had n't eaten for days .
her guts were swimming with parasitic worms .
the next slide is going to be gruesome .
i took these back to the lab .
i extracted dna from them .
could cancers be contagious between people ?
music must be the thing for derek .
that was the great eureka moment .
-lrb- piano notes -rrb- etc .
the other wonderful thing about you is memory .
would you like to hear me play ?
dp : " chopsticks . "
ao : this is derek the musician .
so this is one of derek 's heroes .
dp : " tiger rag . "
so get out your pen and paper .
two billion people without sanitation .
the lists go on and on .
where should we start on solving these problems ?
but that 's a wrong problem to ask .
nobody wants to do this .
we have not had an idea .
we 'd like to know these things .
what would be the price ?
that is what economists do .
these were the bad projects .
why is it it came up ?
that 's a substantial amount of money .
this third best one was free trade .
i 'm all for that .
we 've done this many other times .
each one of those lives matters a lot .
so we really can make changes .
and the disease was all over the world .
one was killing the mosquitos with ddt .
1945 , it 's still most places .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and rich men are afflicted .
and bed nets are a great tool .
it 's great to see .
and so you end up with two choices .
now we 're on the up@@ swing .
bed net funding is up .
there 's new drug discovery going on .
we all had a wonderful education .
and that does n't seem entirely fair .
so , how do you make education better ?
there 's many people working on it .
what are the characteristics of this top quartile ?
and the answer is no .
the variation is very , very small .
it 's an unbelievable thing .
what 's going on ? "
everybody needs to be involved .
and so kipp is doing it .
the data is n't gathered .
and they need advanced notice to do that .
of course , digital video is cheap now .
and i thought it was so fantastic .
i will not dance to that beating .
i will not kill for you .
especially i will not die for you .
i will not forget where i come from .
i will craft my own drum .
our humming will be dru@@ mming .
i will not be played .
-lrb- applause -rrb- a bunch of paci@@ fists .
confused , aspiring paci@@ fists .
i 've been wrong a lot lately .
hold her now with you .
this is " break clustered . "
whose son shall it be ?
which male child will perish a new day ?
our boys ' deaths galvanize .
we mourn women , complicated .
bit@@ ches get beat daily .
profits made , prophets ignored .
sickness , health , tender violence .
language ca n't math me .
one woman loses her head .
one woman gives birth to a baby .
one woman gives birth to borders .
where do refugee hearts go ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- i love theater .
something happened along the way .
being human is an art form .
i know theater unites us .
and zero wants to go to the moon .
it 's a human and technological revolution .
it 's motion and emotion .
we teach , touch and move .
this is an extremely new field .
it 's a terrible business model .
so we really have to change this .
so this is what we 've built .
it 's an automated robotic technology .
some people call this peer-to-peer .
i call this peers , in@@ c .
and i can tell you two great stories .
i say the answer is yes .
let me show you what it looks like .
that blue line there is my brain@@ wave .
and that was responsi@@ veness .
so you use it with your headset .
this is not a fake .
this technology is intra-@@ active .
would you get a divorce ?
this has literally revolutionized cognitive science .
let me give you an example of this .
all right , so what does this mean ?
and the short answer is games .
these kinds of probes exploit it . okay ?
we can compute that during the game .
so where does this lead ?
so how can you live little ?
we need to think before we buy .
my office folds away , easily hidden .
and of course , my own movie theater .
maybe a little more time ? "
it does n't really matter .
and a lot of nationalism came in .
but design - oh , my god .
they think of somebody choosing fabrics .
i think that this is a strange moment .
it 's a diagram of the visual system .
and some things look very familiar today .
it 's gray , form@@ less .
the computer was cracked open .
and it works in a very particular way .
they have great explanatory power .
so what is a drone ?
this is an oil palm plantation in sumatra .
now these collars are put onto animals .
it is a fully autonomous system .
so this is now a public health crisis .
it really involves many different areas .
or we can use both .
the second challenge was cells .
plus we have stem cells .
so we can actually use biomaterials now .
you saw the spray going in .
we can also use cells alone .
so they know what to do .
we 're also working on more sophisticated printers .
and this actually shows that printing .
put a pair of gloves here .
i was able to do more things .
luke , come up please .
my sculptures are normally very simplified .
jh : and they 're non-@@ deterministic .
ts : so something like this .
jh : that 's fantastic .
like the occurrence of moi@@ re patterns .
it 's really manife@@ sted there .
there are lots of things that appear .
is that relevant to your work ?
i mean , i 've got the symptoms .
you think of yourself as the servant .
it 's a terrific studio assistant .
ts : thank you , john .
we got a lot of things right .
they are farmers and factory workers .
a couple of principles : build small .
300 to 500 million cases are reported .
five dollars can save a life .
here are just some pictures of the factory .
it 's the largest company in tanzania .
so the production side is working .
we make them again and again .
we create financial markets that are super complex .
so she 's the perfect test case .
does she make the same mistakes as us ?
so that 's just what we did .
they were these kind of weird things .
so the monkeys get really good at this .
they really cared about their monkey token dollar .
so see what your intuition is here .
so what 's going on ?
and so this is what this looks like .
people here played it safe .
and so what do the monkeys do ?
so what does all of this mean ?
a little bad for monkey investors .
you ca n't just shut that off .
we 're just built differently .
and here 's the rub .
this is a portable ultrasound .
and actually , can you see libby ?
should i do that again ?
tb : yeah , let 's do that .
i had a care coordination problem .
and here 's the most important part .
it 's a constantly falling process .
so we have two prototypes .
let me demonstrate how it works .
the front wheels rotate like this .
so , this is climber .
we developed our adaptive gait planner .
we get so many visitors visiting our lab .
this robot is an amoeba robot .
so , it 's an open loop control .
and now darwin ii is completely autonomous .
it is not remote controlled .
so , this is last year in china .
this is this year in austria .
darwin also has a lot of other talents .
where do we come up with these ideas ?
so , really , we have five secrets .
first is : where do we get inspiration ?
where do we get this spark of imagination ?
nobody critici@@ zes any opinion .
so , education is very important .
there you go . thank you so much .
-lrb- applause -rrb- i love the internet .
and it 's happening during our lifetimes .
so let me show you something .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- now , 1986 .
that 's 25 years ago .
here 's a typical street view .
and i knocked on the door .
and that , obviously , is a problem .
they are both right now on the run .
nobody knows where they are .
i mean , the internet is international .
that 's why we call it the internet .
how do you actually track them down ?
let me give you an example .
it 's not used for anything .
so obviously i googled for it .
i got zero hits ; was n't there .
and he drives a very nice car .
how do i know about this car ?
because he blogged about the car .
and this is what runs our infrastructure .
everything is being run by computers .
everything is reli@@ ant on these computers working .
or perhaps not quite on earth .
what safety they had was very sc@@ ant .
we could n't do them without technology .
here 's a bit more .
being run over is never easy .
they did it by remote control .
and people are looking like this ...
only one person had ever done it before .
and that 's centre point in london .
project ex@@ celsi@@ or , it was called .
they first dropped some dummies .
this is joe kit@@ t@@ enger himself .
this is him in a pressure suit .
you need a pressure suit .
and what must that feel like ?
i did quite a lot of research .
that 's in new mexico .
the body swells up . it 's awful .
i 'm confident that we 'll find one .
i think it 's a great challenge .
thank you very much for your time .
i want to warn you about that .
that 's just human nature .
now , we have a rationale for that .
and it 's natural to do that .
it 's not going to save the world .
this wo n't hurt . okay .
so , what do those terms mean ?
that 's a non-zero-sum game .
this is n't only about religion .
and i am illustrating still .
so this takes care of my age .
this was about 19@@ 25 .
industrial designers want to make novel things .
and that was in hamburg .
this was my first job .
moderator : yes , i am sure .
this was a very dangerous accusation .
were n't you there recently ?
it is really a sacred space .
everyone 's listening . we 're responding .
and we wo n't react to it .
it 's a very puri@@ fying experience .
ready , just play some time .
this is a science of listening .
yet , these men remain dead .
so it 's more dis@@ ordered .
this led me to blood .
a bloodline is determined and ordered .
so they 're testing its virulence .
her name is z@@ um@@ ra .
i 'm interested in these ideas of repetition .
this is a boys ' bedroom .
this is a girls ' bedroom .
and that was what i did .
we were the best and the brightest .
the wind blew very strong .
it 's one of those things .
and they tasted really good .
we use nets that are 20 miles long .
and the habitat destruction is unbelievable .
a book was written about it .
it 's a bit of an embarrassment .
that 's the same species .
and then this is amazing .
except it 's supposed to be brown .
but what does that mean ?
we really do n't know .
but my subject is national security .
i 'm talking about opec oil .
what is the decision point ?
and one trillion of that goes to opec .
raise your hand if you think you know .
why do we have 11 aircraft carriers ?
do we have a corner on the market ?
somehow that does n't seem right .
that 's not sustainable either .
there is no free market for oil .
so where are we headed from here ?
and it does not require a refinery .
do we have enough natural gas ?
it 's what we use a year .
i think it 's probably 175 billion barrels .
there are eight million of them .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's your concern .
i 'm back to theorist again .
and so the margin is natural gas .
we are overwhelmed with natural gas .
tbp : well you say a big investor .
now i do own stocks .
i 'm not a big natural gas producer .
but i also am in the fueling business .
you burn it , you release co2 .
why does n't that prospect concern you ?
what do you have to replace it ?
where are we headed ? "
the government is not successful on these things .
but that only blew out 500 million .
and now i think reformers are safe .
you ca n't - okay .
tbp : i 'm teasing .
i got out of school in ' 51 .
i saw my first one in ' 53 .
tbp : how do we get there ?
it 's because of air quality .
and i say , that is your problem .
then we get more personal with it .
have you ever had any diseases ?
what gender do you like to sleep with ?
the boxes are too narrow .
and this can get really dangerous .
i grew up in a very sheltered environment .
i mean , who knows , right ?
no one is exactly shocked .
i was not an activist .
and then we made this .
it 's written in the declaration of independence .
because i already am all of those things .
i just wanted you to know that .
it 's been around for about 7,000 years .
so this looks something like this .
we 're now going to turn it on .
and this works like that , instantly .
we want you to stop doing that . "
and we do that with electricity .
there are eight children in the family .
five of them have dystonia .
so he is one of five kids .
he did not respond to any drugs .
it is the sadness center of the brain .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- anybody interested in that ?
they shut down . they turn off .
these areas of the brain are shut down .
so this is now in clinical trials .
we can now reach those circuits .
it 's very flat , kind of rigid .
and that 's bu@@ mp@@ top . thanks !
meet tony . he 's my student .
we are here for knowledge .
and something changes for tony .
i want to know what is wrong .
i want to know what i know . "
so tony starts doing his homework .
we believe in risk awareness .
we care how we make our profit .
like ted , i believe in people .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it 's fairly self-@@ explanatory .
and how are they transformed by wearing it ?
and i thought , " well , hey !
let 's take a snapshot at aviation .
these things tend to happen every 25 years .
this is a picture here taken from orbit .
and the inventor is in this audience .
so fun is def@@ end@@ able .
there were a couple of examples here .
so all of these galaxies are moving .
how do we see that galaxy ?
but ignore the top part .
and the answer is yes .
and it 's an enormous amount of mass .
so they 're moving further apart .
so the expansion slows down with time .
this was a completely surprising result .
the big questions facing physics .
we are doing a thousand now .
you can put it louder if you can .
and aurora liked to play video games .
just fast forward 10 years .
and that 's exactly what they do .
so where are we taking all this ?
the na@@ palm is burning there quite nicely .
it 'll just bake your retinas .
they 're very important in oil spills .
oil does n't sink , it floats .
it also makes it very visc@@ ous .
it 's incredibly hard to clean up .
i am helpless over this . "
and that 's actually very perverse .
you have these pictures of birds .
in fact , it 's continued to increase .
i was there in 2003 .
it 's become this intense industrialized zone .
we actually encourage people to drive more .
so , three million barrels a day .
-lrb- applause -rrb- time flies .
why did i do it ?
and these were all incompatible .
it was just very frustrating .
the frustration was all this unlocked potential .
well , some people did .
that 's what it was like then .
let 's start with government data .
that 's important . why is it important ?
i can use it in my company .
we want un@@ adulter@@ ated data .
can you say " raw " ?
audience : raw data now !
it 's very very important .
but , that 's not true .
in fact , data is about our lives .
bing ! relationship . data .
i did that . me !
that 's how linked data works .
and we 've practiced that .
so , linked data - it 's huge .
ok , so it 's called linked data .
i want you to make it .
i want you to demand it .
he died broken by history .
all the adults knew the risks .
something stiff@@ ened inside me .
i lived in parallel worlds .
i did n't know the protocols .
so i followed my hunches .
we worked well into each night .
i made the decision to move to the u.s.
her mother raised her alone .
my mother phoned minutes later .
" you have not let it go . "
defeat would have come too easily .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
they work even when you sleep .
reduc@@ tive listening is listening " for . "
it 's a really big problem .
it looks a bit like this .
there is a cost of compression .
now that 's a really serious problem .
protect your ears in that way .
it 's been around for thousands of years .
i do urge you to explore this .
first of all , listen consciously .
you can do this in groups as well .
protect your ears ? yes , absolutely .
so i urge you to take that path .
i wish you sound health .
you 'll find it inside of you .
the first is feed@@ stocks .
and this gets us back to the mushrooms .
it 's a waste product .
biological yield is really important .
they laughed . they dismissed us .
it gives you a sense of the trend .
and i 'm trying harder and harder .
mom , i 'm really trying .
it is saving the tigers .
it is stopping the tar sands .
it is all of those things .
your robe gives it away . "
we need that in the world .
here 's another woman hero of mine .
she says the airports of the world .
working for peace is very creative .
it 's hard work every day .
i 'll tell you the quick story .
the children were killed on the spot .
it was mairead 's sister .
she is now running for president .
they could maybe volunteer that much .
it 's not a dirty word .
this is lake bai@@ kal .
the lake is entirely frozen .
and they have dedicated their lives to it .
it 's very harsh conditions .
they work on a sho@@ e@@ string budget .
an extraordinary set of telescopes .
here 's another view of the same .
this is cosmology 's final frontier .
it 's an extraordinary place .
and that process takes about two hours .
the fabric alone weighs two tons .
this is a close-up of the buddhist monastery .
and both require silence of some sort .
and here is another picture of them .
they are supposed to be locked up .
now , let me give you an example .
i 've had it . "
at the beginning , it was a disaster .
that 's what they had all their lives .
here 's a piece of chocolate . "
that 's what perspective is all about .
white europeans were subject to the plague .
so , this thing is 0.@@ 75 millimeters .
some are public . some are private .
takes about 3 million dollars the second time .
this is the way it should be seen .
i wo n't go there .
it wo n't do anything for you .
changes the way medicine works .
you can break this out by states .
what 's the net effect of this ?
here 's differential productivity rates .
it 's got nothing to do with privatization .
his village is near mogadishu .
maybe a year passes , nothing .
he is introduced to this young woman .
he starts this new life .
he has a purpose in life .
they pretty much do nothing .
would i have become a terrorist ?
they sought people like him out .
but his story takes a different route .
so mohamed saw an opportunity .
it 's about creating a social impact .
mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
i believe he is selling hope .
this is the grand cafe here in oxford .
you would be sharper and more alert .
so , the technology is there .
this is a statue from oxford .
darwin is a great example of this .
that 's in his autobiography .
it will be useful in 2020 .
but that 's a key thing .
that 's an interesting idea . "
we should record it . "
that 's pretty cool . "
could you work on that problem ? "
and that 's how gps was born .
chance favors the connected mind .
and these are base stations .
these are cellular mobile phones .
and one of the issues is capacity .
and radio waves are limited .
and that creates a big problem .
and security is another issue .
these radio waves penetrate through walls .
so these are the main four issues .
and light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
then there 's ultraviolet light .
so it 's inherently safe to use .
so we have the infrastructure there .
can we use them for communications ?
and it has a very nice acute property .
so let 's show how we do that .
and the light goes through that hole .
-lrb- applause -rrb- once again .
and the answer is yes .
and then i 've mentioned the availability .
you need to see what to do .
you have lights in an aircraft .
and then there 's security .
but i can give you a few examples .
well you may see the impact already now .
and we want to learn other languages .
it 's a very w@@ u@@ zzy line .
they have very sophisticated cooperation .
they know mental as well as physical suffering .
so , this is a pretty grim picture .
how can we do it ?
roots make a firm foundation .
every individual has a role to play .
the philosophy is very simple .
we do not believe in violence .
so how do we solve ?
chris anderson : one - one to two .
and we 've talked a lot about that .
secondly , the resilience of nature .
is it out there with the politicians ?
it 's in our hands .
it 's really up to us .
and played around with this a little bit .
you all know about embryonic stem cells .
so these are my illusion glasses .
all right . very significant mark .
now the parents are really al@@ armed .
i promise she read that text .
we 've also found an unintended consequence .
the boys call me f@@ ag@@ got . "
and yeah , we 're there .
it 's fast , it 's pretty private .
i want to prevent this shit from happening .
so think about a cop .
you could inform school policy .
i was making all these scribble pictures .
it was destroyed before it ever existed .
so it allows it to roll .
and i thought up a lot of ideas .
and here is a similar sculpture .
that 's the sun at that end .
this is a little stone ball , floating .
so you can see it rotating here .
this is a clock i designed .
i came with a plan .
it weighs about 20 tons .
it 's completely silent and non@@ polluting .
so that 's pretty much it .
and then i get asked questions .
there 's an enormous amount of anatomical variation .
and the answer is skeletons .
i tried a bunch of different stuff .
a lot of it did n't pan out .
and moreover , it has to work .
and a hydrostatic skeleton uses two elements .
it has to be part of the explanation .
the arrow shows you the long axis .
the cloth 's cut on the bias .
i was really surprised at this .
he could n't have been more wrong .
we 've got limits on our time .
it 's really , really tiring .
the other dog does n't have the button .
the second dog lap@@ ses into complete depression .
it 's an interesting question .
because they are actually the same thing .
we did n't have a framework .
do n't give them 24 white pills .
it 's called ch@@ unking .
this is a toll crossing in britain .
it could revolutionize the public services .
and so they 're predominantly interested in psychology .
i think they 're right .
von mises completely rejected this distinction .
and he used this following analogy .
try this quick thought experiment .
and it 's vital we understand this .
-lrb- applause -rrb- i 'm a storyteller .
it will dry up inside .
my mother became a diplomat .
and that gap is very intimidating .
a function is attributed to fiction .
it was just a story .
the other , in nu@@ ances .
the other recognizes no frontiers .
identity politics is made of solid bricks .
literature has to take us beyond .
like that , my fiction as well .
i 'm not connecting to them .
i 'm suffering from gallery fatigue .
and i leave feeling actually unhappy .
this is the most glorious painting .
so that keeps me coming back .
how does vermeer know her ?
a servant , a lovely servant .
so , she 's in the house .
how do we get her into the studio ?
well , he compartment@@ alizes his life .
and he decides to paint her .
he has her wear very plain clothes .
these paintings took a long time to make .
he 's never going to look at me .
silk , gray , those beautiful buttons .
only george could call me rosy .
he managed to make the word tender .
he should not have been surprised .
and it 's a charming read .
his intent is to be funny .
remove it from your household .
and it did n't stop there .
qatar is no exception to the region .
her answer was quite the contrary .
we know that modernization is happening .
they make a lot of money .
we do n't want their collections .
for me it was a new discovery .
it 's important for two things .
we should not underestimate it .
this is a very interesting journey .
this is what it looks like .
i assure you , it is very true .
and i ended up on top .
they matched , they found his myspace .
we 're moving towards persistent identity .
-lrb- applause -rrb- chris anderson : thank you .
got a couple questions for you .
cp : yes and no .
there are plenty of downsides .
ca : okay , well .
what 's the commercial picture here ?
the site has adult content on it .
ca : that 's very cool .
cp : that 's a good question .
the population explosion was unstoppable .
the acid rain was falling on the forests .
child mortality is down by two-thirds .
how did we achieve that ?
these are both real objects .
the other is obviously a computer mouse .
well , it uses sexual reproduction .
one goes extinct for the other to survive .
it 's a unique human feature .
no other animal does it .
he does n't need adam .
he can make his own spears and axes .
and the answer is about half a second .
tens ? hundreds ? thousands ?
and that 's the way society works .
but i 've got no evidence for that .
they were a highly cooperative species .
they were a highly intelligent species .
the tasmani@@ ans were isolated .
i mean this quite seriously .
he just knows how to run a company .
we 're just the nodes in the network .
we 're the neurons in this brain .
however , bad things happen .
so thomas watson was n't listening to us .
we did n't have the technology to transmit .
so what were these strange noises ?
radio could carry sound without wires .
but the noise did n't disappear .
-lrb- fu@@ zz -rrb- thanks .
suddenly it was n't here at all .
well , commercial hunting happened .
there 's an upside to the story .
it happened to lots of mammals .
and the aurochs was like the bison .
it went extinct in 2000 .
a little bit of film was shot .
sorrow , anger , mour@@ ning .
do n't mourn . organize .
it 's kind of like an evolution machine .
alberto worked with the bucardo in spain .
-lrb- applause -rrb- it was short-lived .
so what do you do about that ?
there were just 25@@ 4 left .
these have been private meetings so far .
what do people think about it ?
do you want extinct species back ?
what are they concerned about ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- chris anderson : thank you .
there 's going to be unintended consequences .
we will get wool@@ ly mammo@@ ths back .
but what about natural forces ?
so this did n't require any invention .
normally it 's at the back .
we 're catching wind from both sides .
so this is happening in the netherlands .
but new properties of a sailing boat .
you want to have a network of innovation .
it 's to replace competition by collaboration .
so what is open hardware ?
essentially , open hardware is a license .
so it 's a very simple condition .
what 's next for us ?
now on to the detection algorithms .
-lrb- applause -rrb- that 's really amazing .
this is " disappear . "
okay . let 's try that .
e@@ g : losing concentration .
now smile to go straight .
i was then 19 years old .
i did n't see abed coming .
was i what had been done to me ?
i felt a pan@@ g of nerves .
we looked down at his laminated mug .
i had come for remorse .
abed spoke three quick words .
" yes , i suffered . "
we looked up at the wreckage .
" strange , " i said .
" strange , " he agreed .
abed had said something remarkable .
i forgot my discre@@ tion .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thanks a lot .
it 's about disillu@@ sion@@ ment .
i do n't believe in straightforward narratives .
these things really interested me .
i traveled to the gaza strip .
and that was exciting - that was fun .
the foreign office was very generous .
but they were random things .
what was i going to do ?
and so i was in crisis .
i felt just something 's broken .
and i started to fall .
and i gave it up .
and what was i going to do ?
but that was one of the reasons .
and so that was the idea .
and watching ? what if !
we are all intimately connected .
the u.n. was established in 1945 .
that is the state of the world today .
something 's got to be done about this .
so i started off in a traditional mode .
super-@@ logical , you would think .
that 's my story . thanks .
go out and look like a diplomat . "
and so how did you handle that ?
ma : from some people .
the women in bosnia were being raped .
and it was really terrific .
more women 's voices at the table ?
thank you for joining us today .
ma : thank you all . thanks pat .
wires suck , they really do .
the other thing is , batteries suck too .
and they really , really do .
40 billion of these things built .
so how does it work ?
you know . what about safety ?
we live in a magnetic field .
and then finally , electric vehicles .
these electric cars are beautiful .
credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners .
so , i 'll plug that in .
it creates a magnetic field here .
it causes one to be created out here .
imagine if you can get rid of it .
so , i wanted to show you something .
this a google g@@ 1 .
it runs the android operating system .
it 's odd . it has a battery .
-lrb- applause -rrb- and nokia as well .
i 'm a spectro@@ scop@@ ist .
because my job is spectroscopy .
i never deal with images .
what i see is this one . "
and we have a cool atmosphere .
it 's cool for me .
but you know , everything is relative .
and now this is a work in progress .
it can be an indication .
you 've heard about solar flares .
and we found that everything is normal .
so this is a mystery .
because can you imagine everything boiling ?
then you have to convince your colleagues .
now imagine doing this test for other planets .
there can be different ways doing this .
we have been working very hard .
i think it will not come from ufos .
it will not come from radio signals .
we lived on robert e. lee boulevard .
early fil@@ er and late fil@@ er . "
they may not have their dad .
" will you help be their dad ? "
i was like , " yes ? "
what would you tell them ? "
eighty-@@ five percent are under 21 .
now david is my literary agent .
i was at a wall . "
do n't give in to the wall .
we set out on crutches .
take a walk with a turtle .
behold the world in pause .
my lost year was my jubi@@ lee year .
i want you to live . "
who wants to be il@@ logical ?
we thought everyone could participate .
orchestr@@ al arranging is constructive .
they use analysis as well .
and education is not keeping up .
there 's a need to revitalize them .
this conference is filled with wonderful ideas .
" is it amusing ? " the analytical .
the balance . thank you very much .
we 'll look at ocean warming .
what frigh@@ tens you ? "
now , why is this so complicated ?
there 's air-@@ sea interactions .
it looks down@@ right tropical there .
it 's the and@@ ri@@ ll project .
here 's the cartoon on the left there .
and here 's what we found .
this is absolutely beautiful stuff .
and it could be larger than that .
this is from champion island .
here 's how we sample the corals .
and it been growing for about 600 years .
so we have a diamond drill .
each one of those is a year .
here 's a synthetic diagram .
we work with tree rings .
so , you can not argue with that .
the interface is the os .
same thing for processor speeds .
so we 've got that incredible ramp@@ -up .
so we 've forgotten to invent new interfaces .
that 's 8 a.m. shadows .
they get a little shorter at 9 a.m.
short shadows at noon and so forth .
this work is 15 years old .
and that 's all well and good .
let 's do something a little more difficult .
we can fly around them .
so navigation is a fundamental issue .
we can organize it this way .
here are some selection planes .
there 're a lot of elements .
maybe select a little bit of that .
we might want to ask for some help .
kevin , can you help ?
we can zip through them as a possibility .
we may need more than one .
i mean it 's been 25 years .
it 'll be built into architecture .
ca : well that 's cool .
and i understand what you 're asking .
ju : it 's been a great pleasure .
do you know what i wanted to be ?
i wanted to be a bi@@ ker chick .
my ability and my potential .
and they did n't even know .
wonderfully , my eyes decided , enough .
asking for help can be incredibly difficult .
and it 's frightening , is n't it ?
oh , for the love of god .
it 's such a small thing , right ?
god no , it was therapy .
hardly appropriate at this moment in time .
he thought i was mad enough anyway .
but i did know the game was up .
really not a very sensible thing to do .
i always run it perfectly fine .
and i did n't know what to do .
i had lost my belief .
look where my belief had brought me to .
and it did happen this way .
and nobody can tell me no .
i know how to be mowgli .
from global management consultant to elephant handler .
but i knew i would .
i ch@@ ucked in my job at accenture .
that 's what i wanted to do .
it just seemed that it was possible .
this is me , all of me .
i no longer want anybody to be invisible .
we all have to be included .
and stop with the labels , the limiting .
how can i understand those invisible forces ? "
and i say , " empathy .
it all begins with empathy .
here , i 'll give you an example .
this is what i saw .
and then i asked myself the question .
and just imagine what you would feel .
and you 've got to feel that .
okay , so that 's the warm up .
that 's what you want .
you 're arab muslim living in iraq .
you want a better life for yourself .
so here , let me help you .
and you know why they have a design ?
the americans , they 're rich .
and back home , what do you see ?
poverty , despair , struggle .
this is what you see .
it 's part of your life .
and you talk about it with your friends .
you ca n't help but think that .
but there 's something else .
and they do wonderful things .
whatever . i do n't know . "
you know what it means .
it 's a holy war against muslims .
that 's what this is about .
these christians , who are these christians ?
of course you 're going to think this .
and go to the website .
and you 're reading this website .
you do n't know that .
so these guys , you see them .
they 're my students , my friends .
that 's what they are to you .
of course , you got it wrong .
you 're gener@@ alizing . it 's wrong .
you do n't understand the americans .
it 's not a christian invasion .
but some of you do .
and this is a perspective .
now here comes the radical experiment .
so we 're all back home .
she 's anybody to me .
so i want you to go there .
what do you think about that scene ?
okay , try this . bring it back .
this is the scene here .
these gentlemen here , they 're insurgents .
it should n't be that difficult .
now , put yourself in their shoes .
are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders ?
what do you think they 're feeling ?
you see , that 's empathy .
you 're allowed to hate these people .
and they build a big , complex world .
everything in your life has changed .
listen to other people , enlighten ourselves .
the indian family said , no way !
our friends think we 're mad .
our parents think we 're cuc@@ koo .
what do we mean by beyond ourselves ?
until i made a cartoon about 9/11 .
it caused so much trouble for me .
and this directly translates into my paintings .
name it , i 'm on it .
you know where this is going .
how , you may ask ?
i can actually visualize my future approaching .
and it really informs my painting .
history as an imaging tool ?
i actually included stories from my grandmother .
go tell facebook to figure that out !
i like to think - thank you .
shukran ! -lrb- applause -rrb- good morning .
he started this with no money .
it is ourselves we are helping .
it is ourselves we are healing .
the problem of blindness is gone .
they receive comprehensive eye exams .
and how much will they pay for this ?
and we do about 300,000 .
now , how do you create compassion ?
there are a bit harder issues .
it is ourselves we are helping .
it is ourselves we are healing .
i do a radio show .
this is a wonderful thing .
that is a wonderful idea .
but it 's not gone .
well , there is one provi@@ so .
that is a good thing .
this is a wonderful thing .
and that is a wonderful thing there .
pain does n't go away either .
now i know you do n't think that .
i 've done some tests .
you house is in a terrible state .
your partner is about to return .
you think , what should i do ?
i 'm sitting on a train .
i 'm sitting on a chair .
i 'm glad the universe is pointless .
that 's not the point . "
i can make my own purpose .
you can make your own purpose .
thank you very much . goodbye .
so this is for real .
and that 's actually a conservative estimate .
and that was 19 ye@@ as ago .
the 404 page is that .
it 's that broken experience on the web .
and it serves you the 404 page .
but these things are everywhere .
this is a global experience .
that 's the 404 feeling .
-lrb- video -rrb- guy : joey !
each one of them found this .
it turned into a 24-hour contest .
this is one that bla@@ mes you .
this is one that i loved .
and i said , " great . "
i thought i was very clever .
so i started studying anthropology .
so we have this thing called ambient intimacy .
and so this is very important .
it actually looks very organic .
how had i spent my valuable time ?
it was deep in my imagination .
and i started to train .
it 's a smiling face .
and i put together an expedition .
and there 's de@@ hydration .
and there are all kinds of problems .
no stone left un@@ turned .
you save the french for last .
and i knew i could do it .
you 're immersed in the liquid .
your body does n't like the saltwater .
help me ! somebody help me ! "
and the next thing is paralysis .
and i gave in to the staged swim .
and i got back in .
and the dream was crushed .
i 'll just swim right through them .
and they do this wrapping .
" henry , what 's your question ? "
i finished the swim like this .
i was swimming with this thing on .
so now what do i do ?
we 've all had a heartache .
but that ocean 's still there .
this hope is still alive .
no , that 's the last swim .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you . thank you .
i 've learned to be flexible .
now my mother was different .
and i just ate it up .
i was launched as a cartoonist .
we pass it down from generation to generation .
humor relies on the traditions of a society .
i think you can get change .
but i found my place .
and that really resonated with me .
-lrb- applause -rrb- oh , thank you .
i think we have a situation here .
and i did a little calculation of this .
is n't there something shorter ?
i actually like that one .
i would cut my costs by 90 percent .
he always proves us wrong .
they just had some general comment .
here are some of my favorites .
it 's a huge list .
so i had 50 overall summaries done .
our lives depend upon these creatures .
and i 'd like to show it .
assisted in this by bil@@ lie holiday .
that 's in the united states .
and we need that knowledge .
amateurs can do it also .
i wish you would help them .
that is my wish . thank you .
pick a percentage in your own mind .
the answer turns out to be two percent .
again , please pick a percentage .
which brings me to my second point .
all of you , right ? palm up .
you can do it immediately , right ?
right-@@ molded you say , with iron ?
forward , do n't move the wrist .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- now , the shortcut .
so , that was the warming up .
now , i need an assistant .
and i will give my tribute to water .
officially , i do n't gamble but ...
which one shall have a good poker hand ?
that 's a challenge . i like this .
i start with three queens .
yeah . so , good .
this is a little risky .
any style - yeah , good .
not at the last card .
zoe : stop . lg : yeah .
i think i have it .
so - oh , jack of spades .
so , jack of spades .
23 - 24 , sorry , 24 .
you see , yeah , perfect .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- another person .
maybe you will cut ? lift .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- we do it again .
excellent . i love that card .
so that 's a tough challenge , right ?
and queen of hearts . yes !
so , now a false count .
eight , nine , 10 .
now , to the satellites things .
did the camera got it ?
do the cameras see the cards now ?
you see the cards ? yes .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- yeah , good .
it does n't matter to me .
and we switch this to the king .
i like this guy , yeah .
armani - who said armani ? you ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- ah , this is tough .
we try . yeah . you help me .
lg : ok , now .
stop . do you see the pattern ?
yes , yes , ok .
oh sorry , i dropped one .
i think i will do it ...
at this distance , it works immediately .
but it was - did you hear ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- yeah , good . yeah .
looks good , like batman . ow !
and it was ok . one more ?
so , what was the card ?
diamonds . ah , i memorized hearts .
maybe i 'll stand up . half .
three - three of diamonds . yes !
four - i like challenges , yes .
lg : yeah . also listen .
this is maybe a little tough .
zoe : five of diamonds , yeah .
yes ? zoe : yeah .
lg : six - six with the thumb .
nine ? yeah ? correct ?
yeah . five . five seconds .
what should i actually try to replicate ?
they were - had camera moves on them .
that does n't move . "
this time it 's called the facebook .
crowds are gathered in tahrir square .
so exit the rock star .
look at what 's been achieved .
look at the pictures these data sets print .
there 's still work to do .
ca n't be true , can it ?
we do love a good baseline .
there are all kinds of benefits to this .
makes us look really young .
and the next one is really beautiful .
but you can do something about that .
you can do something about that too .
it 's not going to kill you .
so the queen goes down in there .
this is a three-year-old colony .
so that 's what the midden workers do .
so there 's this whole network of chambers .
they somehow get into this reserve .
so here 's some blue nest maintenance workers .
the nest maintenance workers become foragers .
they smell with their antennae .
the pattern itself is the message .
but it works pretty well .
and i thought , " great .
it 's ephemeral just like us . "
what is the reality of that ?
so this is a big issue for us .
wh@@ a - what do you do ? "
i do n't know , you know ?
the place is 64 square miles .
he 's got a great chapter about it .
where did they get that inspiration ?
so , this used to be completely smooth .
in fact , i design nuclear reactors .
this is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle .
you would not believe it !
and i resemble that remark .
it 's a big tooth . "
study of the ancient climate is very important .
and i get lots of pictures like this .
they do n't have them .
that 's kind of what it 's like .
that 's it , thank you .
ak : the ancestor of the horse .
okay , we 'll do something with it .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- ha@@ ha@@ haha .
ak : ha@@ a ha@@ a ha@@ aa .
bj : from an actor .
puppets always have to try to be alive .
bj : his mother was a puppeteer .
and he 's controlling the ear movement .
ak : it seemed a lovely idea .
so we began with a test .
so we made a model .
it had to be shipped to london .
bj : about 40 people .
ak : we were terrified .
the horses are completely handmade .
joey boy , you there ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- -lrb- applause -rrb- joey .
move around . come on .
here , craig is working the head .
horses ' hearing is very important .
it 's almost more important than their eyesight .
he 's working the leg .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- horses are so unpredictable .
the hind legs have got the same action .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
again , that was a practical consideration .
it 's three heads making one character .
-lrb- wh@@ in@@ ny -rrb- thank you .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you . thank you .
i thought that was it .
these doctrines seemed unproven , abstract .
saint augustine made exactly the same point .
and it was a physiological response .
and so i did some experiments .
do you know what it is ? anyone ?
and would you do me a favor ?
i get a sense of anticipation " ?
now i 'm not a neuroscientist .
so how do we make that actually work ?
it 's a plastic bag .
is it beautiful ? is it exciting ?
i 'm watching your faces very carefully .
maybe there 's an innocence to it .
stop . stop . how do you feel ?
i watch what people do .
that 's not the expression of joy .
there 's something else in that .
and that 's packed in there as well .
so it was n't about symmetry .
i 'm not getting it off the eyebrow .
it 's something much bigger .
and i feel that here .
titanium lac@@ qu@@ er on this .
i 'm really getting into this now .
massi@@ mo tam@@ bur@@ ini .
no one 's noticed , have they yet ?
did you see what i did ?
i moved three things by a millimeter .
so that 's okay , is n't it ?
and only a few people can do it .
and a team rarely can do it .
so all hail to that .
are you ready ? okay .
it wins or loses at that point .
it 's fantastic , is n't it ?
you did n't maybe know it .
but how do you feel about it ?
form is function . form is function .
now i did have an advantage .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so i read slowly .
only god knows the true meaning .
paradise is quite the opposite .
he was not a political prisoner .
and the third is commitment .
could we do something for these 93 countries ?
but cambodia is not alone .
or is it other countries ?
but it is in so many countries .
a judge would let her out . "
never going to happen . "
that was a nice thing to get .
henry james would be proud .
a fundamental issue that 's not being addressed .
we call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition .
" and where does it go ? "
so we need some help there .
there is no finish line .
this is obviously a color photograph .
they showed up in five days .
we lay out the building areas .
the waste systems all connect .
i 'll just say , july .
he 's interested in playing football .
so why would i worry ?
the average concus@@ sive impact is 95 gs .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- if only .
she 's totally not kidding . "
there are some great resources out there .
it 's at c@@ d@@ c.@@ go@@ v.
the second thing is : speak up .
speak up also with coaching staff .
it is so much stranger than you think .
this one is a two-@@ bit counter .
these are little mechanical computers .
these are five-@@ state state machines .
and the universe is now a compiler .
this is three minutes of uv light .
let me just give you two examples .
so , you see two examples here .
it 's about a centimeter on the side .
the lines around the edges are a polymer .
why do we choose paper ?
so , the production capability is there .
and here you simply burn it .
the printers cost 800 bucks now .
that takes about two seconds to make .
and so i regard that as done .
do they have a common cold ?
it works really , really well .
they were not the only ones .
aids had become a chronic disease .
luckily , those patents did not exist everywhere .
thirty-@@ four million are infected with hiv .
and there 's something else .
they also stop passing on the virus .
so what 's the problem ?
well , things have changed .
first of all , the rules have changed .
this shows you a patent landscape .
this is the landscape of one medicine .
that can be generic manufacturers .
he has access to antiretroviral drugs .
his son will soon be 14 years old .
and this is no longer fantasy .
already , i 'll give you an example .
this has never been done before .
this has never been seen before .
even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools .
so , it was a world without grandparents .
how much learning can you do ?
so , humanity is our greatest invention .
but of course we 're not done yet .
it 's a very , very strong force .
it 's the increased order .
we actually do n't know .
that 's where technology is going .
your cat wants more food .
that 's what progress is about .
and we are aware of the price .
even technology wants clean water .
this is a brand new song .
it 's hard to know .
it 's based on a real life experience .
hello , eleanor , please ...
i wanna talk to randi .
i 've got a question for randi .
i want to talk to the amazing randi .
do you have a laminated badge , eleanor ?
i want my million dollars .
no , i do n't have a badge .
this song is called " the alphabet ...
bring this campaign to these countries .
your mom would be so proud . "
jung in afghanistan - you get the picture .
yet , there is hope .
so , doctors prescribe medication .
no one can survive alone .
and partly this is already happening .
so the key here is empathy .
and 70 percent re@@ gained their lives .
so i believe this kept me running .
i thank you for your attention .
all these things happen to me .
and so this was just an amazing experience .
it absolutely means something more .
just imagine if that 's a black guy .
so she 's painting her little families .
this is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
it 's the same thing .
i 'll look away from the picture .
we ca n't keep doing that .
you know , it does n't work .
seventy percent - it 's unbelievable .
and that has to change , you know .
it really is just a new idea .
what goes in is what we are .
we really are what we eat .
what 's going to happen ?
and why can they serve that much ?
this is not even food .
everything came in plastic , in cardboard .
the usda allows all of this stuff .
they 're not going to be smart .
and you see these recipes on the side ?
we have to start changing this .
where is learning to talk ?
you know , we have to change it .
we have recycling in all of our schools .
we really need to change it .
it 's going to take more money .
we need to educate the kids .
we need to educate the staff .
but we really have to educate .
that number probably needs to double .
you know what ? we should be ashamed .
we can all make a difference .
and our minds have altered , too .
now this has raised all sorts of questions .
a crow can peck at a fish .
the other is a bird . "
hamburg is a city in germany .
are there camels in hamburg ? "
none of these problems are real .
how can we address them ? "
and let me give you a few illustrations .
so the tenor of education has changed .
the professions have been upgraded .
or take a farmer today .
i 'm primarily a moral philosopher .
how would you feel about that ?
they 're just inherited mo@@ res .
they could say a semic@@ ir@@ cle .
they live in the bubble of the present .
as if they were a rep@@ tile .
so i came up with the following setup .
let me show you what this looks like .
should i skip that part ?
it 's a liquid that is completely black .
it 's got an oily consistency .
so that was the second project .
let me demonstrate this over here .
it 's got nothing in it .
so that 's how those images were made .
what 's the idea behind it ?
is it just a waste of whiskey ?
is it just some strange materials ?
compare these to the actual numbers .
there 's 10 tickets in this lottery .
well , bernoulli tells us it is .
imagine that you 're going to the theater .
you also have a 20-@@ dollar bill .
most people answer , no .
what the hell difference should it make ?
let me just give you an example .
most people say they would .
you 've all had this experience .
what do we find now ?
what makes this dynamic inconsistency happen ?
these guys can tell us .
i 'll take the 50 dollars now .
is terror the right response ?
ca : there 's no question .
people died ; so be it .
and so we evolved these responses .
ad@@ g : in persuading them .
but these are tricks around the margins .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
he had a gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an ego .
it was always fun to be with him .
celebrity sandwiches was their thing .
these guys were philosophers of mind .
their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness .
it 's a scientific question after all .
but it was really brutal .
he really popped their balloon .
i do n't think he was right .
but he was convinced of this .
the man was incredibly curious .
we were in les hou@@ ches .
we were up in the mountains , 1976 .
and feynman 's eyes just opened up .
he went off like a light bulb .
so , well he did .
he went out and did an experiment .
he wrote down a simple thing .
it was the technique of feynman diagrams .
this was more or less known .
they 're difficult integr@@ als .
people were trying to do them .
feynman said , " forget all of that .
the electron hits it suddenly .
you see a frozen bunch of partons .
this was the key to analyzing these experiments .
but how should we honor feynman ?
how should we really honor feynman ?
there 's no suggestion of a relationship there .
i 'm not using any hypothetical data .
they 're all weigh@@ ted equally .
it 's an extraordinarily close correlation .
it comes from the world values survey .
same thing is going on .
but look at the scale of the differences .
again , quite big differences .
there 's more social mobility .
japan is rather different though .
it has a smaller welfare state .
this is just one example .
it also leads to status insecurity .
now we have been criticized .
otherwise that would introduce bias .
why do n't we control for other factors ?
we spend a good bit of time .
and we should begin by reimagining leather .
now how do we do it ?
it 's natural connective tissue .
it 's environmentally responsible , efficient and humane .
it allows us to be creative .
but this is really just the beginning .
so , take a look .
but this piece is due out in may .
for babies , it 's deadly .
many of you have probably used this .
massive solution to the problem .
it looks like the technological problem is solved .
that 's actually not true .
maybe there 's a biological answer .
ok , the american population .
it 's not just medicine .
this is the last mile .
the last mile is , everywhere , problematic .
alright , what 's the problem ?
they do lots of inconsistent things .
the mind is more complex .
think about what that means for a second .
i do n't think that 's stupid .
just does n't make sense .
now , the model is intuitively right .
it 's more complex than that .
how much does the ball cost ? quick .
let 's think about 10 for a second .
this is easy , $ 1.@@ 10 .
i know algebra can be complicated .
let 's go back to kindergarten . ok ?
that 's all it is . ok ?
audience : red . green .
yellow . blue . red .
what is all this telling us ?
but it 's more profound than fun .
bmw is a pretty safe car .
here 's another puzzle for all of you .
see , you have a mental model .
researchers have found these type of anomalies .
it harnesses something you already believe .
maybe it 's the diarrhea .
this is a typical insulin injection .
now , carrying this thing around is complicated .
here is an innovation , a design innovation .
the needle is particularly sharp .
you just gotta carry this thing around .
this is about energy efficiency .
all right . thank you very much .
so , this whole area is so fascinating .
consider a few stats for a moment .
it never left my brain .
the network has two components in them .
what is the cost of that battery ?
you have the crude oil .
that is an 80 cent gallon .
now this would have been a wonderful paper .
peres thought that was a great idea .
we then decided to scale it up .
it 's inver@@ sely proportional to taxes .
we decided to come into the u.s.
it 's called the other car .
why is this a big issue ?
that wo n't do much difference .
we have 10 million cars by region .
that 's an enormous amount of cars .
we have all these regions .
no infrastructure , no problem .
these are perfect matches to one another .
that 's one percent a year .
one car emits four tons .
and what would it do to our economy ?
we have to make the right moral decision .
we have to make it immediately .
this image here is from 2008 .
the pink dots represent host properties .
let me give you an example .
let 's just take a look at chris .
you know , it 's very interesting .
it 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
we design unique elements into this .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
we applaud the well-@@ man@@ nered box .
it 's based on wonder .
it 's something very personal .
that 's what expression is .
expressive spaces may disturb us .
even the mind is emotional .
i think that is the progress of cities .
our whole practice depends on computing .
it is complex . space is complex .
and yet , our lives are complex .
our intellectual desires are complex .
it 's not only the giving of answers .
you know we can simulate almost anything .
so the unexpected is always unexpected .
those shapes are difficult to change .
it 's an art of communication .
and these are our dreams .
it 's not about decoration .
now i am a believer in democracy .
it 's such a complex project .
there are emotions of the victims .
and that is where i end .
how are they entitled to practice ?
thank you , and god@@ speed .
trade walls began to come tumbling down .
transportation walls came tumbling down .
this is practically the model of ted .
the reason for this is incentives .
in this case misery truly does love company .
one idea , one world , one market .
and for that i am very grateful .
that is a good thing .
now we 're not there yet .
india is coming on line .
africa is coming on line .
now think what this means .
1900s : maybe one percent .
that 's not that far .
we wo n't make it .
but some of our grandchildren probably will .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- alright what about problems ?
you can see this in the data .
one idea , one world , one market .
now remember here what jefferson said .
now i 'm talking about the ' 30s .
the product was that airplane .
but it built a romance .
i wanted to build airplanes .
so i built model airplanes .
you had to learn about aeronau@@ tics .
you should be in the art department . "
and i said , " why ? "
so i started doing that .
i conceived the kind of airplane .
and that 's the way i work now .
there are draw@@ backs to this .
they will sit in them forever .
he came over and looked at it .
and he showed her the lever .
so i spent a long time .
and stop where you want .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- just your own .
and that 's a lot of load .
and breath@@ ability is good .
-lrb- applause -rrb- i love video games .
i 'm also slightly in awe of them .
and yet , many of these get built .
it gives you great powers .
but this is n't the really interesting stuff .
fifteen is a pretty optimal number .
there 's 100 percent up here .
so all this is very powerful .
so we can do some rather amazing things .
they think this game is unfair .
our games do n't always do this .
so what does all this mean in practice ?
third , you reward effort .
and fifth , the element of uncertainty .
and two things really flow from this .
this can all seem very sinister .
the word " addiction " is thrown around .
there are real concerns there .
this is what really excites us .
let 's start with business .
we can use calculated randomness .
" ma , do n't start ! "
he was born there in 19@@ 24 .
" pa@@ pi , help . "
i 'm telling you this one .
it 's about human connection .
it was a saturday morning .
it 's delicious . it 's savory .
that kind of food , yeah .
i got an er@@ rand to run . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- this is her ensemble .
" we taking your car ? "
" i think so . "
" i guess i must . "
" oh , jesus . "
" are you kidding me ? "
" how are you doing it ? "
" four or five days . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- you should be terrified .
" it will upset you . "
" oh , my god ! "
well , i stood up to her .
you know , she eats small portions .
she wi@@ elds great power .
bless you , dr. watson .
i grew up with this woman .
do n't you want to look ?
oh , jesus . oh , jesus .
she is , after all , cuban .
" i 'm not going anywhere . "
i come out , and there 's esther .
she 's hugging the purse .
she jumped out of that car . "
" what , ma ? "
it does n't have air conditioning .
that 's a boeing 7@@ 0@@ 7 .
now here 's eight centuries of economic growth .
then growth gets better and better .
but you know what the actual facts are ?
this led to a fantasy .
well , it 's a matter of arithmetic .
the first head@@ wind is demographics .
but now it 's turned around .
the next head@@ wind is education .
we have a lot of debt .
and then we have inequality .
so that brings us down to 0.@@ 8 .
are we going to grow at 0.@@ 8 ?
they did it on a scru@@ b board .
then they had to bring them in .
and by 1950 , they were everywhere .
what about the electronic revolution ?
here 's an early computer .
but by comparison , we can learn .
we can benefit from others ' ideas .
we can build on their wisdom .
social learning really is visual theft .
they 're far closer together than that . "
they slow the flow of technologies .
and they even slow the flow of genes .
and they impose a barrier to cooperation .
that 's 15 minutes of our cup consumption .
and i wanted to show the number .
and do you remember the response ?
we just dismiss it out of our consciousness .
thank you and good afternoon .
but what really threatens humanity ?
well , here 's the dirty little secret .
so let 's explore how vaccines work .
now , what does this mean ?
so what we 've got is a situation .
so think of it this way .
let me give you another example .
these are largely hidden from the immune system .
so , here 's an alarming thought .
now think of where this leads us .
-lrb- applause -rrb- chris anderson : thank you .
so , the science is changing .
so , the challenge is full speed ahead .
this is an ocean planet .
so i have one message .
well , it 's the relative importance .
okay . let me criticize this thing .
this is an ac@@ ry@@ cli@@ c sphere .
it 's truly a three-dimensional space .
ok , this is good stuff .
she has twice the wingspan that i do .
there i 'm coming ; she sees me .
i 'm trying to do everything very gently .
it took 10 years to build .
this is a wide-@@ angle camera .
so we 've run two flight schools .
these people are deceived , forced .
some pay the price for it .
and we are silent about them .
we think it is shortcut .
it 's in that context that i work .
she earns around 12,000 rupees .
what has been my challenge ?
i ca n't hear from my right ear .
my biggest challenge is society .
it 's you and me .
that 's my biggest challenge .
can you just encompass these people too ?
they are also part of this world .
they died of aids last year .
this is the pu@@ dong area .
this is a key issue .
that 's not too good .
the picture there is khrushchev .
let me look at this question more directly .
is democracy bad for economic growth ?
both countries are in asia .
and which one is a democracy ? "
those two countries are geographically similar .
china was during the cultural revolution .
the whole country went mad .
this is an extremely strange fact .
so india is rever@@ ting to the normal .
what about the political system ?
comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark .
this is a very impressive record indeed .
it has the improving fundamentals .
so let 's first talk about focused ultrasound .
it is made out of silicon .
you see the phantom within the aquarium .
it 's just a lesion formed inside .
we can do it without harming any tissue .
they were missing the vision .
and i will give you several examples .
so the first one is in the brain .
so i 'd like you to meet john .
and medication did n't help him anymore .
and the objective of that ?
you see the transducer , the light blue .
and it does this burst of energy .
this does n't cause any damage .
this is an immediate relief .
he said , " miraculous . "
i mean , those people lose their independence .
they are dependent on others .
and john today is fully independent .
he returned to a normal life routine .
he suffers from no neuro@@ deficit .
he 's back to his normal life .
many patients like that favor radiation therapy .
so again , this is an immediate relief .
and he has been very happy .
show us some primary cancer .
what can be done there ?
so i have good news and bad news .
women suffer from that disease .
this is a big fibro@@ id .
so new life was born .
he can stop the surgery at any moment .
now i have n't got anything against efficiency .
so it looks a little bit like this .
is this really how people are ?
the first one is in the crisis itself .
they want to spend less and save more .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- what is the objective ?
it is about opening up .
what does all this mean for economics ?
ecosia is an internet search engine .
it has to be about transition .
what can we offer those people ?
prosperity is a shared endeavor .
let me begin with my parents .
we were four girls and no boys .
children do n't choose a school .
out of 100 , 90 are your creation .
you ca n't do a thing about it .
why i said this , is the background .
so i 'm going to move on .
here i got a prison assignment .
and then how did i deal with them ?
and they did n't say anything .
these are hundreds of classes .
it was the beginning of a change .
books came from donated school@@ books .
that 's the second landmark .
one thousand prisoners who sat in meditation .
and this is what transformed .
let me show you the next slide .
this was a magic box .
this was a sensitive box .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
haiti was a game changer .
we had basically three requirements .
some 74 percent of people received the data .
and they are giving a voice to themselves .
and convert it to humanitarian good .
so that 's theory , that 's great .
and a few rise to the surface .
it 's literally defining a new field .
and apparently it smells like bacon .
was she pregnant when she died ?
watch her horses . -lrb- laughter -rrb- .
so i 'm trying to penetrate that .
well , here is the image .
but then this changed suddenly .
this was another newspaper image .
they thought it was real .
and me as the queen .
then i made a book .
but it slightly bo@@ res me .
you can read it in about two hours .
the people from london came up .
but there was ones in the literature .
she was a crystallo@@ grapher .
he said they were wrong .
and we knew we were right .
it 's the order of the four bases .
most scientists are really rather dull .
rna provides the information for protein .
so what 's the meaning of the controls ?
basically , no one 's very happy .
and teachers are also frustrated .
it 's actually very popular .
what 's the point of teaching people math ?
did it answer the question ?
and also verify it - crucial step .
that 's an amazing amount of human endeavor .
for example : mental arithmetic .
it 's a major subject .
i do n't think it 's warranted .
why do you think that was ? "
they 've got hair all over them .
and we open up so many more possibilities .
you can do so many more problems .
so calculus has traditionally been taught very late .
how many years of protection do i need ?
this is n't some optional extra .
this information is also pretty staggering .
we did n't sequence his genome .
it 's a horrible term of trade .
and this is the 21st century .
now brd@@ 4 is an interesting protein .
it remembers that it 's cancer .
we just started mailing it to our friends .
i have a small lab .
and so we did just the opposite .
and this was , unfortunately , successful .
it 's not orally available .
for us , a major and exciting milestone .
yet this information is largely a secret .
now the business model involves all of you .
this research is funded by the public .
it 's funded by foundations .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
and it 's a very easy question .
you have not changed the story .
you have that much uncertainty .
so the correlation is low .
it is a completely different notion .
daniel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
that does not hold for emotions .
thank you , danny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
the evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
they 're just learning how to count .
-lrb- video -rrb- boy : how about this ?
same as the other side .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i do n't know .
ag : okay , hypothesis two .
boy : it 's lighting up .
it 's good to be a grown@@ up .
video : this is the land .
it is rough and it is flat .
in places it is cold .
in some it is hot .
but people live on this land .
so that was just a little sni@@ p .
it 's not enough to create one .
this is a relatively famous chair .
this is something called a sp@@ lint .
now look at that plastic chair .
the chair is done in 1949 .
they focused on the need .
they tried to solve the design problem .
it 's kind of a brutal quote .
the familiar one on the lower right .
i want to give you one example .
so here is the tiny creature .
design was not something other .
it was part of the quality of life .
and here is some family pictures .
so we 're going to watch another film .
and now i 'm going to test you .
so can you read it ?
also rode on one . i ...
ed : okay , good .
so you guys did pretty good , cool .
it 's sort of an alternative universe .
and the town has really embraced it .
and you try something out .
but here is what 's really great .
so this is charles ' voice .
but you can go beyond that .
i really thank you for your time .
and electric fields are not magnetism .
they begin to be attracted towards earth .
and we can see them dividing throughout .
the one within the circle manages .
it 's a death sentence .
we divided the patients into two groups .
he received the standard treatments .
there 's none of the ti@@ redness .
her cancer continued to grow .
it 's only the beginning .
this is coming from the heart of finance .
unfortunately , the answer is yes .
i ended up in physics by accident .
you encode it into equations .
these are just a few examples .
so what do we know about complex systems ?
how are they organized ? are they isolated ?
i think this is an interesting question .
this is the normal notion of control .
and the network really matters .
let me explain by giving you this analogy .
and it gets even more extreme .
and this is slowly starting .
but this is just my own personal ideology .
it was deep at night .
i do not remember what time it was .
we only talk about one side of it .
it 's like dying from insi@@ de-@@ out .
this is the language of ster@@ ility .
it is a chess game .
there are two sides of war .
not one , but 50 percent .
she got a support network .
she learned about her rights .
i will meet you there .
let us all meet in that field .
that 's how we improve .
how would i know who was the best ?
consider the rankings for reading prof@@ ici@@ ency .
the u.s. is n't number one .
what would that system look like ?
my name is sarah brown we@@ ss@@ ling .
turn to somebody next to you .
but we still have more work to do .
the impact for teachers would be phenomenal .
i hope you are too .
and we have taken pictures like this .
and there are features that look tectonic .
you are looking at a shoreline .
but this is somewhat of a shoreline .
this picture is taken at 16 kilometers .
and here is the horizon , ok ?
this is the sahar@@ an desert of titan .
we utter about six metaphors a minute .
this is the mathematics of metaphor .
and fortunately it 's very simple .
second step , conceptual synesthesia .
we all have synesthetic abilities .
this is the bouba / kiki test .
can we do a quick show of hands ?
sexually attractive people are hot .
sexually un@@ attractive people leave us cold .
this is the st@@ roop test .
you can take the test now .
sadly , it 's metaphorically true .
but this is how metaphor mis@@ leads .
and they had to make a decision .
and these fossils still breathe .
but there is a better translation .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- is bill gates here ?
change it ! come on ! what ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- ah ! okay .
this is from their actual book .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- djabran fluctus .
i go to chry@@ so@@ ker@@ as .
and of course there will be advertisements .
i did some more investigation .
something is as@@ kew here .
" yeah , go to your room . "
that seems a little silly to me .
there are no jo@@ vi@@ ans .
that is the premise of this particular presentation .
the dodecahedron , it 's dual .
this would be a normal wave pattern .
and for me , that 's a win-win .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- better really hurry up .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- what a handsome cat .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- when did this happen ?
" yes , mama . "
i knew those two were related .
there is the orange system .
twenty-@@ seven years of my life !
unbelievable . this is like crazy .
am i the only one that sees this ?
these are maps , by the way .
they start looking like planets .
i look at the orbits of the planets .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- kepler was right .
hey , you ca n't make this up .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- thank you very much .
what does the world want to do together ?
this must drive you crazy .
by which this might happen .
ca : thank you , thank you .
it 's totally ra@@ d . "
but her igbo was n't too good .
so she took me along to translate .
and she told this woman .
and i was supposed to do this alone .
so , this guy comes with me .
i was a wi@@ mp .
i cried for a very long time .
take anything you want out of the suitcase .
it 's your birthday present . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it 's incredible .
it does n't require a tremendous thing .
i offer to this ground , this gin .
this is for you , old man .
this gin , this salty earth . "
you would n't have any ...
you have to get away from verbal language .
my mind works like google for images .
i see only specific pictures .
ok , how about famous ones ?
just really quickly , like google for pictures .
that was like just so super cool .
this is ten@@ sor imaging .
you 'll see these different kinds of minds .
now , another thing is the sensory issues .
cattle are the same way .
you see , it 's a different picture .
people have a hard time figuring that out .
it would be their airplane tails .
it 's tails , pure and simple .
and this brings up mentors .
he was a nasa space scientist .
we need to be doing that .
you 're getting that kid turned on .
it was great to be here .
what are you most passionate about ?
and it 's very , very simple .
you directly observe a few simple things .
you can literally see them .
let 's take a look .
let me point them out .
so this , swine flu - pink .
let me highlight it for you .
why is there a gap there ?
let me show you this .
can you guess what this data set is ?
you might want to get some chocolate in .
and here 's my visual c.@@ v.
i 'm not quite sure i 've succeeded .
but i wanted to convey something to you .
and i 've never been to design school .
i just kind of learned through doing .
it 's the language of the eye .
it 's got to be america , right ?
because america is an incredibly rich country .
that changes the picture considerably .
of course , 2.@@ 1 million .
there 's always conflicting evidence .
so it spaw@@ ns itself .
so let 's filter that out .
which was emitting the most co2 ?
so we can have a look .
-lrb- applause -rrb- this is revolution 2.0 .
because everyone was a hero .
yet , nothing was happening .
in fact , people were extremely frustrated .
it 's helping all of us to connect .
there are lots of people who are frustrated .
it was an educational campaign .
i still remember the photo .
people did not believe this .
he was a middle-class guy .
his photo was remembered by all of us .
get those who killed this guy .
to just bring them to justice . "
people were making fun of the idea .
they were actually attacking them .
yes we can . we can do it .
i was detained on the 2@@ 7th night .
i was not allowed to speak with anyone .
the fear is no longer fear .
facebook has 1.2 billion users per month .
so this is target , the company .
yeah , the dad was really upset .
we can do all of this really well .
it 's four pages , easy to read .
we have good models of it .
so this is pretty complicated stuff , right ?
we know how to predict all that .
we totally can do that now .
that seems to me to be a problem .
so users control their data .
and it 's not a diet .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- you just never know .
other studies have shown this as well .
they believe that things can be done .
let me confirm what she said .
that 's how i 'm standing before you .
so that is the house of tata .
-lrb- applause -rrb- innovation , compassion and passion .
and you can see the cartoon here .
let me tell you a bit about it .
until midnight , he 'd be thinking .
but who was the team leader ?
volkswag@@ on was 1@@ 1,@@ 3@@ 33 .
and british motor was around 11,000 .
and those dreams are getting fulfilled .
the driver 's name is nar@@ an .
he has bought his own nano .
what is its price ? 20,000 dollars .
and they climb up for their work .
a challenge , of course .
you just do n't have it .
" did it hurt ? "
" no ... not at all . "
-lrb- applause -rrb- an incredible story .
the cost of treatment , 20,000 dollars .
time for development , not 10 years .
we are in a hurry . five years .
cost of development - 300 million dollars .
these targets have been achieved in india .
and how they have been achieved ...
you can see before treatment and after treatment .
it 's about ultra-low cost .
you 're not talking exclusive innovation .
you 're talking about inclusive innovation .
they 're not available in africa .
and incubator costs 2,000 dollars .
i was also afraid of those 18 minutes .
what do you think that drove you ?
and there was a bright spot up there .
and then the paper burned .
what does that focal length do ?
what does that convex lens do ?
the verb is the chassis of the sentence .
hundreds of verbs can go both ways .
only humans can possess things .
so why should anyone care ?
now , relationship types can be negotiated .
nothing ven@@ tured , nothing gained .
so this is a rather fraught situation .
so you get the best of both worlds .
this fish was revered by humankind .
what do they like to eat ?
what is it that they 're happy with ?
we 've actually tagged 1,100 tunas .
we see a flick of the tail .
that is where the tuna spawn .
and we 'll wind in the target .
you can see why they might be caught .
we just need to put it together .
so we can save the bluefin tuna .
we can save the white shark .
we have the science and technology .
that 's 58 billion dollars .
expand the pipeline down to the consumers .
so , you 're in a big corporation .
the users can be producers .
this is new ; this is traditional .
let me just give you two examples .
there 'll be huge professional arguments as well .
those were the two places .
what should be the role of public policy ?
because basically , he does n't service them .
you 've got two options .
that costs about 100 dollars .
this is unprecedented , and it 's big .
it 's just going up through the roof .
the modern sail@@ plane is super@@ bly efficient .
we get to do the classic .
ok , here we go .
on zero-@@ emission vehicles in california .
you hear about it all the time .
you read about it in your newspapers .
you hear about it on your television sets .
how sad are you right now ?
and there is a slight down@@ turn .
but that 's not the case .
we might learn something unexpected .
we take less notice of trivial matters .
the numbers wo n't determine the outcome .
a bigger one for you to look at .
now , it 's about 35 percent .
and what goes on in the future ?
here 's a piece of limestone .
it 's about 400 million years old .
now , here 's a piece of chalk .
this is pretty incredible stuff .
all the same , what 's different ?
here 's a piece of coal .
the oil will never run out .
" ah ha ! american , great . "
his name was jabbar . "
you owe us two billion dollars . "
" why would i do that ?
for example , dubai - cool place .
it 's like a drug deal .
come here . come here . come here .
and they do n't get paid that well .
and what do i mean by that ?
one young woman brought her grandfather .
now , lets take some data . facebook .
a lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed .
the first gentleman , he 's a baker .
so , none of these cases are unique .
maybe you had a direct line .
that was where the focus had to be .
and then the school en@@ acts perfectly well .
and they are doing it massively .
100 percent are using text .
i will start with my wife , chaz .
the first surgery was a great success .
my carotid artery had rup@@ tured .
at first i was against it .
but it was n't that simple .
the flow is n't natural .
a very large sample is needed .
all of this has happened in my lifetime .
does anybody remember that ? "
they give me a way to speak .
but no you do n't .
i am writing as well as ever .
a guy goes into a psychiatrist .
okay , just a moment .
-lrb- whirring -rrb- all right .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- oh , sorry .
and those resources are going away .
fusion is very hard to do .
we 've been trying for 50 years .
nuclear energy comes for a simple reason .
it 's a medi@@ um-@@ sized nucleus .
so , most of the time they repel .
and that energy is what powers fusion .
there is one trickiness about this reaction .
and then we get to uranium .
so , how would we make it ?
and in fact we can make fusion happen .
it gets very expensive to do this research .
seven nations are involved in building this .
we have to get to this .
we have to get to a power plant .
so 2030 looks like an infinity away .
let 's call it island networks .
what was his terrible crime ?
that 's a significant number of us .
and so that 's just programmed into you .
because i am hiv positive .
these are terrible and tragic figures .
now there are still many problems .
but changing the law is n't .
-lrb- applause -rrb- everything is interconnected .
that 's part of you up there .
i 've learned to respect the lightning .
my hair used to be straight .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i 'm just kidding .
all my relations . thank you .
how did i get started in this business ?
he 's a spanish architect and designer .
a nice visual composition of symmetry .
ha@@ vana is a wonderful area .
the experiments are incredibly simple .
and these vary tremendously from region to region .
but it has roughly 500 genes .
the chromosome is literally blown apart .
every major religion participated in this .
this will take about 30 seconds or so .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- amazing . amazing performance .
i have no interest in that whatsoever .
and that turned right away into another project .
well , then we get to this image .
we construct it and we construct those ideas .
so , the mutations rever@@ ted to symmetry .
calculus is also a mathematics of curves .
it 's just a curve without inflection .
i work with a group of other architects .
we have a company called united architects .
see , for instance , in this picture .
you did n't trust information very much .
the first works were actually objects .
and i called them reli@@ cs .
this is the clown skull .
and it 's totally over@@ kill .
" fi@@ at lux . "
and i wanted to deal with other subjects .
i got some photographs from them .
" val@@ ici@@ a . "
" jac@@ yn@@ the . "
" pa@@ para@@ zzi . "
so they 're like perfect actors .
my time is nearly up .
i needed to put it into a context .
so where are the phoenix islands ?
they 've never been dived . "
and i said , " yeah .
but i was in for the adventure .
seamounts are important for biodiversity .
it 's an interesting fact .
and we finished our trip .
and that 's the area again .
in the west we have the gilbert islands .
just get whatever anybody wants . "
and are you free for dinner ? "
so the conditions for success here are listed .
you can read them yourselves .
the idea is very , very simple .
you can see it in pe@@ dr@@ o .
where 's the right finger ?
this is the so-called sl@@ ur@@ ry wall .
" how could 9/11 have happened ? "
it will bring all of your family together .
you 'll eat countless gourmet meals .
your life will have new meaning .
and this , and then this .
but i would n't change my experience .
why are we spending $ 135 billion ?
why are we still stuck in afghanistan ?
every one of those statements is wrong .
and the same is true for the troops .
you feel deep , deep guilt .
so we need to change that institutional culture .
a million properties have been returned .
the national army has shrunk .
but you need to look at context .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
we could have done that .
bg : rory , thank you very much .
we started with two schools .
we think we 're onto something .
it does n't animate them .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- none , huh ?
i 'm going to talk about dinosaurs .
i hope you all realize that .
and there 's lots of different shapes .
they went out and gathered them up .
and this is an interesting story .
and this was in the early 1900s .
where are all the little ones ? "
they like to name anything .
they 're very well taken care of .
so that 's what i do .
and so we will evaluate them .
they say , " go away . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so here are 12 dinosaurs .
guess where that came from ? dragon .
because , well we know why .
scientists like to name things .
so it is going to get bigger .
and we know why , right ?
so everyone had a big one .
and that 's pretty cool .
and the little one is really spongy .
and the middle size one is really spongy .
it 's a big skull .
an@@ ato@@ titan : giant duck .
so we look at the bone histo@@ logy .
and we get rid of an@@ ato@@ titan .
so we can just keep doing this .
and the last one is t. rex .
so we cut into them .
it looks like it could still get bigger .
and of course , nano has 17 .
and that 's a good number .
and they 're not happy with this .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- thank you very much .
they just made it up .
our best weapon is sunlight .
we do n't even find dead bodies .
a bit counterintuitive , right ?
the urban honey is delicious .
again , a bit counterintuitive .
why are bees doing better in the city ?
they do n't experience this .
the bees just are n't around anymore .
and it worked out that way .
why did he buy this book ?
but none of them worked .
and that 's what it looks like .
and now we think we know .
he was an exact contemporary of demosthenes .
to find three is completely weird .
and that 's what he did .
and institutions can learn from this .
and that is the future of the web .
they go to see the mona lisa .
what about a society today ?
are there any general conclusions that arise ?
the most devastating case of complete deforestation ?
ca : that scale delivers efficiency .
em : yes , it does .
that 's the natural cadence of a trip .
what 's unusual about that ?
the whole ecosystem is solar-powered .
-lrb- applause -rrb- ca : how ?
most people choose to lease .
we will install panels on your roof .
you decided to build a space company .
why on earth would someone do that ?
how on earth have you done that ?
it 's much like on a jet .
that 's why it 's so important .
ca : definitely more expensive .
and we 've had some good tests .
what is it about you ?
em : well , thanks . thank you .
and you have to do that .
not all of them have happy endings .
this is some of my early work .
it 's just a big blue surface .
i saw forests and meadows .
for instance , take these sea turtles .
or take this sea cucumber .
he 's like an underwater spiderman .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- or the blow@@ fish .
the blow@@ fish is like the incredible hulk .
or this lion@@ fish for instance .
he 's a great white shark .
we sort of worked things out .
i could n't fit them in .
it 's cruel , it 's wasteful .
ostensibly , he 's dead now .
sherman 's up in shark heaven .
and they turn up the lights .
still same is true of israel today .
now why do we call david an underdog ?
it 's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon .
this is an incredibly devastating weapon .
saul has the same expectation .
that 's where his strength lies .
goliath is not what he seems to be .
now that is weird , right ?
he 's not even carrying a sword .
why does goliath not react to that ?
there have been many articles written .
famous . he had acromegaly .
because he ca n't see him .
the world needs you , badly .
there is going to be no turning back .
technology is increasing at a comparable rate .
the search for knowledge is in our genes .
they did n't teach it before then .
make a fra@@ y of your own .
find out what they are .
-lrb- applause -rrb- oh , thank you .
so this is how it works .
this is a video prototype .
so this is a very early prototype .
and there 's no wires .
-lrb- applause -rrb- my name is am@@ it .
and it took 18 months .
and i grew up in india .
you look around at all these museums here .
you want to navigate around the museum ?
i see this plus sign .
now this is one of the images .
you can zoom around very simply .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
but then you really want to go deep .
and apparently it was quite popular .
you zoom in . you really go in .
i probably should n't say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and the answer is no .
it 's to supplement the experience .
and the west is engaging with that .
ten percent 's come from india .
and they 're investing in energy .
and it 's not just about african demographics .
a bit dangerous , sometimes .
so what 's africa looking like today ?
this is how i look at africa .
south africa is playing a role .
fragile democracies is the bei@@ ge color .
strong democracies are the orange color .
he won by a margin .
it 's a positive , virtuous circle .
every poor country is corrupt .
every rich country is relatively un@@ corrupt .
you see the middle class grow .
india is one of those examples .
and then something happened in 1980 .
boom ! india began to explode .
because technology does let you help .
my ipod 's full of them .
but they have those social skills .
you see them on the mountains up there .
and this leads to oddities .
now i 'm a middle-aged guy .
it was just sheer terror .
it tells us what to imprint .
babies come with this ability .
but this is the source of innovation .
it stands for mutually assured destruction .
so this was chapter one .
here is their first big public announcement .
it was just really , really frightening .
chapter two starts in 1991 .
so , what is a nuclear terror threat ?
all of this information is relatively available .
they are very dedicated and committed .
you put the elements into a suitcase .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- you assume that .
you 've got to get out of there .
man : how do you know ?
and here is what it does .
see that tail ? that 's incredible !
and it was unstable without its tail .
and you can also have active tails .
it can also be used in defense .
and we ran it up a surface .
the engineers had a really good idea .
but geckos do it better .
and they do it with their tail .
if we could have the lights on it .
okay , there it goes .
so we can maneuver this way .
it can actually swim through the air .
here 's what i 'm talking about .
let 's hear from tony hay@@ ward again .
a new bubble will replace the old one .
the earth always did have limits .
they were just beyond our sights .
there are still no limits .
there will always be another frontier .
the oil is not liquid .
it is terrestrial sk@@ inning .
an escape hatch has been reached .
a new frontier has been found .
we badly need some new stories .
that this is our only home .
i do n't have a clue .
mother ther@@ esa , she was rational .
pretty much everybody is rational .
that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers .
imagine a problem with just five decision-makers .
five fac@@ torial is 120 .
no . how about 10 times ?
we 've increased it to 3.@@ 6 million .
nobody can keep that straight in their head .
alright , lets turn to iran .
he is on the way down .
so it would be a good thing .
bb@@ m : thank you .
and i was actually a rocket scientist .
but it was an exciting experience .
yet , i had a very good answer .
and i said , " really ?
because is n't that easy ?
i mean , we have life .
but here 's something . "
and then you see something like that .
so can life be defined ?
well how would you go about it ?
and then you might get something .
but what is this system like ?
can we measure this type of life ?
they have about 28 of these instructions .
so let 's see what that looks like .
so first , nothing , nothing , nothing .
too hot , too hot .
you hit the viability threshold .
the distribution changes to " alive ! "
and then that signature is lost .
what do we learn from that ?
we loosely call them " groups . "
it was black or white .
and who would talk to terrorists ?
now i 'm not naive .
and sometimes military intervention is necessary .
let us turn to afghanistan .
we just have to per@@ severe . "
everybody seems to agree with that .
because we did n't talk .
and you can always walk .
it 's hard , but it is necessary .
let me go one step further .
there 's a revolution going on .
that 's not the point .
social groups are taking to the streets .
should we talk to hamas ?
i think that is wrong .
how will we ever be inter@@ locu@@ tors ?
but talking can be done in different ways .
it 's their right to fight . "
we have to connect with these profound changes .
and what is dialogue really about ?
we are seeing some new signs .
and they brought their knowledge .
thank you for your attention .
people are going to be hurt .
the cheapest products are often the most dangerous .
no , i 'm going to be virtuous .
and we use that as a moral tickle .
we feel so good about ourselves .
not you , but i feel this way .
that bottle winds up getting burned .
we do n't have disposable resources .
we do n't have disposable species .
a cla@@ m@@ shell 's hard .
we would have a different economy .
that should be the goal .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- just so proud .
we have a moral challenge in this moment .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you so much .
what an exciting and inspiring event .
we want to play you one more selection .
and he insisted on beautiful music .
i call them the net generation .
i said , these kids are different .
it 's like the air .
i 'm a digital immigrant .
i had to learn the language .
i mean , think about wall street .
now , what is openness ?
his name is rob mce@@ w@@ en .
and he tells me this amazing story .
they came from computer scientists , engineers .
now secondly , openness is about transparency .
you say you have good products .
they 'd better be good .
but you also need to have values .
now this is different than transparency .
transparency is about the communication of information .
i 'll give you an example .
the pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble .
do you know about this ?
it was a tool of self-@@ defense .
so this is a time of great change .
now , it 's not without its problems .
people did n't know about things .
so we saw the protestant reformation .
but it came with a cost .
now , this thing has a function .
this is a huge collaboration .
could we start to share our intelligence ?
derartu tulu ruins the script .
but then she falls back again .
now the tarahumara are remarkable for three things .
the tarahumara had a different strategy .
so what 's the connection ?
australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .
i 'll give you an example .
so you have these three mysteries .
maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal .
that 's all we could do .
you need a pack to pull together .
they need to be part of the pack .
but maybe it 's something different .
we try to cash in on it .
so what 's the benefit ? so what ?
i 've experienced it personally myself .
so , we have this ability as well .
they go to bed around 8@@ :00 p.m.
so , cut to the modern day .
now that never would have been possible before .
so why are they succeeding ?
and that 's the power of social movements .
so that begs the next question .
is it just about grievances ?
now to conclude , how does that happen ?
well , egypt is a good starting point .
where and how can we draw the line ?
i was also pregnant at the time .
i witnessed the technical difficulty .
4.@@ 8 million suffer cardiac failure .
powerful new technologies always present enig@@ mas .
it was a very revolutionary time .
live with them ; love them .
this was kind of the defining slogan .
well i took one year .
and it was a turning point .
it 's like its own little coupling .
and they have some wonderful properties .
but this is very shaky .
it becomes k@@ ite-@@ shaped .
they always make a triangular roof .
now this is people science .
you just need a ton .
you can play around with it .
this makes an i@@ glo@@ o .
now this is in 1978 .
and this is how you make a valve .
you put a little sticky tape .
well we make lots and lots of pumps .
it 's like a centrifuge .
but this is great fun for children .
they all study about the food chain .
and you put a little fan here .
and this is a hundred-@@ year-old toy .
he wrote a paper on this .
i just put this inside this .
and we 're just trying to see possibilities .
and this is wool over here .
this is very , very simple .
small pulley and two strong magnets .
there will be a spinning magnetic field .
so this is a small crank generator .
it 's been catapul@@ ted to international glory .
and what i do is i study insects .
the fly is going to sense this predator .
now , what about the engine ?
the engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating .
so let 's look at the controller .
they have sensors on their wing .
they can even taste with their wings .
they 're a great model for flies .
they do a lot of the similar things .
at the tail of the fruit fly .
and it 's a beautifully complex neuron .
is there any evidence that flies do this ?
and why is the physiology different ?
it 's a non-@@ spi@@ king cell .
we are anonymous . we are legi@@ on .
we are but the base of chaos .
and they 're pretty scary .
being a victim of hacking for a change .
now this is a very complicated struggle .
and i sort of get it .
they 're completely anonymous , as it were .
and so nothing is going into the hackers .
but what about the real cybercriminals ?
now carderplanet was very interesting .
and after that , it just went wild .
and he did a great job in it .
his slide into crimin@@ ality was incremental .
and let me be blunt about this .
we want to work with you . "
you have these up@@ -and-@@ downs .
this is a super-exponential growth .
we had a global bubble .
now , these are big claims .
we all know the chinese miracle .
the chinese government is there .
they want to benefit from the growth . "
it was not a prediction . "
maybe i am very powerful then .
now , this is interesting .
we created the financial bubble experiment .
we identify ex@@ cesses , bubbles .
this is not a crash .
so there are bubbles everywhere .
but can we really sla@@ y the dragons ?
but it was kind of an interesting thought .
so , this is the way it works .
you put it on a cooking fire .
we have vast budget deficits .
so , starting with the political philosophy .
of course we do n't .
so this was the pre-@@ bureaucratic age .
it was able to do that itself .
so , how could this happen ?
we 're working with some of these people .
how do we make it happen ?
so what does all this add up to ?
let 's be under no illusions .
one of them was " carmen . "
south africans just make music really freely .
they do n't read music .
did you know that ted is a tune ?
-lrb- music -rrb- do you hear it ?
if you 'll pardon the expression .
audience : t , e , d.
shall we try that one again ?
audience : t , e , d.
you wo n't make the key otherwise .
well done , ladies and gentlemen .
it 's called para@@ orchestra .
it was a really extraordinary moment .
no one 's responding to each other .
it 's removed some of my paralysis .
para@@ orchestra is the name of that project .
you can see how this had an influence .
jennifer bau@@ m@@ gardner was wearing them .
i thought they were really hot .
my mom says , " patriarchy . "
my mom says , " protest march . "
i say , " online organizing . "
but we also have a straightforward political impact .
we do n't want one icon .
we do n't want one face .
which brings me to my third paradox .
but how good a failure is it ? "
it 's about embracing the paradox .
and electrolux was going to go to mexico .
" my grandfather worked at this factory .
who is ever going to hire me ? "
what if it all started here at ted ?
we 're using up about five planets .
i do n't need to go into that .
that land there will remain pasture in perpetuity .
we could just re-@@ label things .
how we build things can change as well .
this is a bio-@@ mor@@ phic building .
it takes its inspiration in form from life .
it 's every seven days .
so i rather like this picture here .
we tweak that a lot .
how do we help people like that ?
new models for pedagogy for the displaced .
and we have new tools .
audience : it detects landmines .
and i think that we will .
that 's the theme of my talk .
the pyramid of ocean life ...
now why does that matter for human health ?
we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
they get into the food chain .
adult males : a huge load .
juveniles : a huge load .
these women have toxic breast milk .
monterey is one of those .
in 1932 , that 's the picture .
in 2009 , the picture is dramatically different .
it did n't happen accidentally .
and that was enormously liberating to me .
and this is bat@@ ti@@ sta .
who@@ ops ! passed each other .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- or even " french . "
i could make nothing of that .
and i really struggled with this one .
so , it was going nowhere .
this one generates no imagery at all . "
what 's the heart of this poem ?
there 's a significant difference .
that can be a big contribution .
now , this is a little illusion .
that poster is not folded .
but , we do n't have time .
and the first mate hesit@@ ates .
he throws the first mate to the ground .
hil@@ arity en@@ su@@ es .
so why do we need commitment devices ?
it 's physically possible to lose weight .
but resisting temptation is hard .
and this is a timely issue .
i 'm talking about the topic of saving .
so this is a timely problem .
so what can we do about this ?
on the one hand , it sounds ridiculous .
the first is called the distribution builder .
so this is one of our experiments .
the older face is miserable .
the younger face is getting unhappy .
and i 'll close it there .
not a lot of women did .
now what does that mean ?
so what 's that about ?
but that really is n't true anymore .
you would be issuing orders from above .
you would be very hierarchical .
and here the story is fairly simple .
why ? this is a real mystery .
hr : so there you go .
and this was very disheartening for them .
" that 's your salary .
" who 's the damn man ?
she 's the man now . "
it 's happening all over the world .
and now look at the chart .
that 's from 1985 to 2003 .
so we have the perpetual adolescent .
you can bring your husband along .
and there should be a pencil .
come on : those masterpieces ...
ok ? stop . all right , now .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- there we go .
so , ah , that was fun .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- all right , good .
but why is it important ?
we need to figure that out pretty fast .
we stop ourselves from doing things .
and that actually is n't necessarily really playful .
so it was a pretty successful evening .
and somehow that seems wrong .
and they were doing that through building prototypes .
and we think that 's pretty important .
something like a service or an experience ?
we 're doing the same thing as designers .
you can be serious and play .
his people live in brazil and in peru .
some did , not everybody .
but he was n't dis@@ may@@ ed .
why are you putting yourself at risk ?
and what am i doing ? "
we 're running out of fresh water .
we 're running out of fossil fuels .
we 're running out of land .
but you know all that .
he said , " change ?
things are bad enough as they are . "
i started life as a banker .
even that was n't enough .
they 've pioneered a different approach to villages .
this is dr. fan ji@@ anch@@ u@@ an .
why did he do all this ?
i think it has to start with us .
i get sick . you get sick .
is it something that we survive ?
is it something that we can treat ?
we just have better statistics .
one in four men dies of cancer .
my sister is a cancer survivor .
and it 's an accident .
those are strengths in the system .
you can start analyzing the data .
they would n't go listen to him .
but the young people all came .
it just becomes in@@ tolerable .
they did n't help at all .
and so then he looks at me .
this report is our main public report .
the book is called " blessed unrest . "
think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy .
take a look at these .
in the goal that 's stated .
but i 'm really hopeful .
our future does n't have to be imagined .
but we have a problem .
this is a newspaper publisher and a banker .
and they were great community leaders .
whatever that means to you .
and language is actually a problem here .
we often wo n't even notice them .
i 'll give you the short answer .
now most of the time , that works .
2010 new york , not so much .
a lot of good experiments in this .
so i 'll give you four .
so you can imagine how that works .
we 're also a species of storytellers .
we respond to stories more than data .
we 're really good at small numbers .
there 's a false sense of security .
well , a poor understanding .
so let me compli@@ cate things .
i have feeling and reality .
it does n't change ; it 's real .
so feeling is based on our intuition .
model is based on reason .
that 's basically the difference .
you do n't need a model .
you need a model to understand them .
it 's limited by our cognitive biases .
i was born in new york city .
models can come from industry .
a lot of models come from science .
health models are a great example .
and we 're good at it .
intuitive is just another word for familiar .
this kind of thing happens a lot .
i 'm going to give one more complication .
i think it depends on the observer .
and i call that their agenda .
models are hard to dis@@ lodge .
global warming is a great example .
we can do to the next harvest .
strong feelings can create a model .
i did n't check the airplane .
some of this stuff is hard .
it 's complete security theater .
i 'll give you one , a syringe .
but it made people feel better .
i visit her in the hospital .
i go home , i look it up .
so , what is a black hole ?
so , this is a little tricky .
so why is it so important ?
and then it 's a black hole .
i only need two things .
and your job today is to be skeptical .
and we call them active galactic nuclei .
it 's way more energetic .
but it 's a kind of indirect argument .
and that is because of the atmosphere .
absolutely my favorite star in the world .
you can see a lot of stars .
now , truth in advertising . right ?
and that 's the fun .
and it 's a very fragile entity .
and what does the big black hole do ?
it strips that gas cloud apart .
so , you should n't see young stars .
so , you can already see the surprise .
so , this is the fun part .
so , organisms have this important history .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's enough !
it just bends by itself beautifully .
here 's rhex entering the woods .
you ca n't use regular cameras .
the animal does not use that .
i would feel very isolated during these discussions .
i was intensely moved during all this .
now , hundreds of homes were destroyed .
where does such rage come from ?
and how are we responsible for this ?
they lack even the most basic amen@@ ities .
and that 's the power of storytelling .
i am a native of burkina faso .
i am an example of that .
today , not so much has changed .
i could go to germany to study .
but what to do with this privilege ?
fundraising was not an easy task .
so i had to convince everybody .
i was allowed to use even traditional techniques .
and then the poli@@ shers come .
and the kids , they love it .
the community is looking . it still works .
we wanted to use them to create openings .
how do you cast mud ?
they will do it themselves .
another factor in gando is rain .
it is simply how we protect our walls .
we just wait for the rain to go .
i have become myself known .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- exact equivalent .
as soon as the door closed ...
two out of three ate the marshmallow .
some lasted 14@@ -and-a-half minutes .
they were happy . they had their plans .
a few were still there with bad grades .
a few had good grades .
and let me show you what happened .
that person ate the marshmallow .
then you sell a lot more .
they are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
it is actually a business venture .
in other parts , it does n't .
it 's beginning to grow tremendously .
the reason for that is really very simple .
and thereby hangs a tale . "
life is short , you know .
and this is very critical stuff .
that 's going to have amazing impacts .
the second is modifying our emotions .
the third area is reproduction .
it 's a total media circus .
it will happen in five to 10 years .
they 'll want the new release .
and it wo n't be done .
humanity is going to go down this path .
that 's what we do .
people can try and ban these things .
that is simply not going to happen .
in fact this is n't just abstract .
it 's the beginning of a new millennium .
we 're going to make lots of errors .
that 's the way these things work .
it will always be remembered .
so what 's the data ?
so the data on dropping out is amazing .
what 's the evidence of wiping out ?
and this is two kinds .
it 's a social awkwardness .
my dad has alzheimer 's disease .
that 's a lot of people .
and reading is just about impossible .
that all seems like win to me .
even when it 's so hard .
democracy is the only game in town .
and this is a major issue .
and i 'll start with what went right .
and you have the internet .
all this was very much under attack .
now we have the reverse tendency .
now the elites basically have been liberated .
and basically they do n't fear the people .
before , revolutions used to have ideological names .
and the public was extremely all for it .
but this is the face of resilience .
why are you so passionate ? "
so maybe you could interview her . "
and she was just the start .
-lrb- applause -rrb- but think about this .
and that 's just to start .
i think that is terrific .
we have so much room to grow .
we are not a special interest group .
it is the landscape , right ?
the full score is 72 feet wide .
another adaptation would be this piece .
let 's continue with that same excerpt .
man , her office was packed .
it just takes a little bit more .
you just had to do things sometimes .
she has an issue with authority .
she 's not going to go anywhere . "
why would you want to do that ? "
how do you get to build those relationships ?
so we created a new school .
but we had to do it .
yeah , what if we get it wrong ?
but what if we get it right ?
so , i did it .
that is a forest giraffe .
it has also some beautiful primates .
on their way , they looted everything .
young children . child soldiers .
and that was the language of the war .
and after that , we succeeded .
so , it was so bad .
and there was no way to work .
so we went to meet them .
we do n't think so .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i do n't know . "
and i had mine on my pocket .
see what the wars in rwanda .
that 's because of the language of guns .
but it 's serving millions for the best .
it 's an amazing story .
ca : thank you , thank you .
they were together while praying .
so the rituals came that way .
it 's something terrible , horrible .
it was there for thousands of years .
it should be the citizen 's decision .
you can derive many ideas from that .
that interpretation is quite possible and feasible .
of course , this is a long road .
the cause of suffering is ignorance .
you start off at 1@@ 1,500 feet .
and where does the river rise ?
their central metaphor is a loom .
and this is one of those initi@@ ates .
they call themselves the elder brothers .
these are not dying peoples .
the world remains a rich tapestry .
it remains a rich topography of the spirit .
our industrial society is scarcely 300 years old .
this does not have to happen .
he should be friendly and cute .
if i get in front of romo here .
so i 'll snap a picture .
they change from person to person .
neither am i a veteran social worker .
how many children will you get ?
how are you going to scale ?
how are you going to replicate ? "
so , we started parikrma .
indian academic year begins in june .
no one in their family has spoken english .
no one in their generation has spoken english .
but how wrong it is .
they 'll never be able to cope . "
that 's absolute ho@@ g@@ wash .
fathers have started to attend .
now they have started writing their signature .
the children have taught them .
it 's amazing how much children can teach .
we have taught them nutrition , hygiene .
i ming@@ led with almost everyone .
even now we are in touch through facebook .
my accent with english improved a lot .
and today she wants to be a neurologist .
our children are doing brilliantly in sports .
why is this happening ? why this confidence ?
he has learned how to speak english .
i like eating . i like playing . "
i have been changed with my children .
and yet it 's here .
what are the dimensions of this machine ?
so it 's a very big number .
of course , the memory is really huge .
so let me go through those three things .
and everything will go through the web .
they 're going through the machine .
they 're going to talk to the machine .
the media wants to be liquid .
that is going to be the price .
we are going to be the machine .
secondly , it 's become much more personalized .
we 'll have a better word for it .
it 's going to be mach@@ ine-@@ readable .
i have to serve . "
they work in the field .
they bring out the issues of stigma .
it 's quite extraordinary what they do .
so this is my sing campaign .
this is in the scottish parliament .
the doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
this is the transformation that took place .
the cat likes this version better .
nature always keeps a perfect balance .
this is what we know for certain .
and this is another , and another .
is it bigger ? is it smaller ?
and i 'm also a mother .
it 's also tastes and smells .
and often it does something more .
the specter of mass starvation lo@@ omed .
this is a picture of culture .
now , ascap said they did n't care .
the only thing that 's bright ...
you 're every breath that i take ...
you 're every step i make ...
no one else will do ...
we ca n't make our kids passive again .
" do you have tenure ? "
they are : the arts and parenting .
well , here 's a diagnosis .
and here 's just one example .
what a puzzle - i wonder why .
and that presents us with a choice .
just because it sounds so good .
something to do with words , i assume .
some people just wanted to call him king .
and that title was " president . "
it was like the foreman of the jury .
and so the senate won in the end .
they got their title of respect@@ ability .
he was a great storyteller .
he also told me about the great explorers .
fresh water freezes at zero .
and i had to visualize the swim .
i climbed out of the ice .
this is such an important swim .
and then we walked out onto the ice .
and it is 4,@@ 200 meters deep .
we 've just seen our first polar bears .
you did it ! you did it man !
we need to believe in ourselves .
now is the time to believe .
and what 's the brilliant idea he had ?
what would happen then ? "
right , that 's what he seems like .
so i looked carefully at this guy .
would we have thrown him out then ? "
i was n't doing something bad .
but this was not the case .
we built the hardware and the software .
we 've driven 140,000 miles .
it 's the perfect driving mechanism .
second man : it 's driving itself .
you could regain this time .
-lrb- applause -rrb- the first question is this .
our country has two exploration programs .
why are people afraid of the ocean ?
mostly discoveries made by accident .
it is not a map .
i believe in just enriching the economy .
tens of thousands of active volcanoes .
and it 's then being ripped open .
we went up to them with our submersible .
finding the state of preservation .
we can then build a command center .
and the technology is at hand .
that 's a big thing in california .
i called my parents up .
they 're back in philadelphia .
well , that lasted 17 years .
it 's only 500 miles .
i had a newspaper cli@@ pping .
there are two stories in montana .
they had to take that class with me .
" yes , you can clear cut ... "
no one was interested in oil spills .
and i started walking off .
the road turned into the jungle .
i did n't get shot .
i had no idea i would have a ph.d.
you know , we can do it .
but i know i needed to .
but there 's an interesting paradigm .
it 's not something that 's institution@@ alized .
it 's not taught in universities .
bruno giussani : like this , works ?
let 's see what happens here .
we can speak only with music .
" dan@@ zon no@@ . 2 . "
it 's the idea of computation .
they 're called cellular autom@@ ata .
let 's start off with something really easy .
let 's say the revenue of microsoft .
but that 's just the beginning .
here 's a real simple example .
okay . let 's zoom out again .
stay here . i 've got a question .
ca : benoit mandelbrot is in the audience .
does your work relate to his ?
sw : i think so .
and it was while i was doing my ph.d.
it seemed so intuitive to me .
and i think there are three .
i do n't have an overview .
but is that good evidence ?
what else can they record ?
do you trust fish@@ mon@@ gers ?
do you trust elementary school teachers ? "
that 's a perfectly rational thing .
secondly , what about the aim ?
the aim is to have more trust .
trustworthiness is what we have to judge .
and , of course , it 's difficult .
you can all give your own examples there .
so so much for the aim .
now thirdly , the task .
we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness .
this is the machine below geneva .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
we re@@ conditioned them all , fixed them .
now plants are under threat .
they 're under threat because of changing climate .
this is a nuclear@@ -@@ proof facility .
and those are the dry land species .
and that is very useful information .
and that 's already happening .
so where have we got to ?
these seeds are used for restoration .
how much does it cost ?
2,@@ 800 dollars per species is the average .
and we 're almost there .
that stuff 's cool . "
walked into the lego store .
the dining room looked like this .
you walk there , and it hurts .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- torture , very funny .
wow , you guys are great .
i was like , " yeah .
i suppose we are . "
i have to take a moment .
this is amazing what you can do .
anyway , i 'm out of time .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- let 's see here .
perhaps some circular pieces of metal .
this is no hypothetical question .
they 've found small objects such as these .
well obviously this is a replica .
but who is this person ?
a king ? a god ?
so you see up there one such object .
now that 's a magnificent piece of art .
so how big do you think that is ?
well let me show you .
here 's a replica of one such seal .
so what were these used for ?
which of these hypotheses can be true ?
first , there 's no rosetta stone .
i 'll give you a couple of seconds .
oh , it 's almost 50/50 . okay .
here 's an example of one such text .
so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard .
what about the indus script ?
linguistic scripts occupy the middle range .
now what about the indus script ?
what does this result really show ?
and why were they found there ?
that 's our next big challenge .
can you write it using pictures ?
i 'll give you a couple seconds .
there could be other solutions .
here 's a really short text .
so that was pretty exciting .
it looks like we 're getting somewhere .
i ca n't wait to find out .
that 's a good english sentence .
" mary was beaten by john . "
why are they attracted to these men ?
the sexual abuse of children .
why do so many men rape other men ?
what is going on with men ?
that 's a very naive notion , right ?
how can we change the practices ?
and you know what all this is about ?
it 's called kill the messenger .
we live in the world together .
what about all those boys ?
there 's a whole spectrum .
or could you talk about something else ?
there 's been an awful lot of silence .
there 's no question about it .
but we also owe it to our sons .
they did n't make the choice .
and here 's a prime example .
well , we need n't have worried .
and surprisingly , it became a cult film .
-lrb- applause -rrb- now back to the leopard .
so we knew we had to react quickly .
they ended up sleeping for hours .
we had to deal with these individual personalities .
it 's simply not sustainable .
i call it complacency - our complacency .
they 're essential to the habitat .
i felt i was not talented at anything .
one day , i bought a yo-yo .
i was spending all my time practicing .
i will show it to you .
and after that , the complete fragrance .
it 's not really true .
now , this is a totally insane idea .
working for a fragrance company .
so this is a profoundly inefficient process .
s-h , quite a different frequency .
why should new ideas be accepted ?
education : how do we improve education ?
how do we make stable societies ? longevity .
the future must have some computers . "
so nuclear fusion is our energy future .
well it does n't break even .
i built this in my garage .
what 's the population of the earth ?
let 's have the next slide .
we 're in charge . it 's frightening .
let 's have the next video .
-lrb- applause -rrb- all right .
and my favorite example is always fingers .
i 'm very interested in touch-@@ sensitive displays .
but this is the interesting part .
we are so used to doing monologues .
one is that this book knows about itself .
reading and writing is utterly useless .
that thing is called a captcha .
captchas are used all over the internet .
so let me explain how this works .
so this is how the system works .
so for example , tic@@ ket@@ master .
so funny things can happen .
for example , we presented this word .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's how it works .
okay , that 's sever@@ in hacker .
first of all , translating the web .
a large fraction of it is in english .
it makes a lot of mistakes .
so i 'll just let you read .
so he 's just explaining something .
so back to the question .
unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
so it would be very expensive .
that 's a big problem .
and so basically they 're learning by doing .
so people really do learn a language .
so people really do learn a language .
so let me show you one example .
the top is the german .
so it 's extremely unfair towards the poor .
this is totally biased towards the rich .
so here 's the site . thank you .
-lrb- applause -rrb- so here 's the site .
we have n't yet launched this duolingo .
these creatures are not choreograph@@ ed .
they 're choreograph@@ ing themselves .
there are just three simple rules .
and you see that in nature .
yes , it 's happening here .
on , more on and then off .
you can even be just a single cell .
they 're keeping you alive .
i have some metron@@ omes here .
how can metron@@ omes communicate ?
boy : about the second one .
but how could the crowd become synchronized ?
they 're all having some difficulty walking .
well , we know a few things .
now , dolphins are natural acousticians .
but they have other communication signals they use .
i wish i was that coordinated .
he really wants that sargassum .
and these are artificially created whistles .
now this is video of a session .
you have to keep their attention .
so i try to give her the scarf .
the dolphin 's at the keyboard .
you 've got full attention .
and this sometimes went on for hours .
it 's designed to really be two-way .
we hope so and we think so .
this is studios for artists .
but they are n't in london .
and so you 're stuck on a bus .
so it 's got hybrid drive .
i was going to show four main projects .
and this is a project for a bridge .
so that 's it spee@@ ded up .
it has a symbolic importance .
and an expo is a totally bonkers thing .
and 250 countries all competing .
but this phenomenal project 's been happening .
there 's just silence and a cool temperature .
and i just wanted to show you .
but there was an underlying support .
they 're just chopped at different heights .
so there were 6@@ 6,000 of these .
jc : thank you , thomas .
a few , but not most .
and electronic tattoos also shout .
here 's what happened to this company .
so what if andy was wrong ?
so lesson number one : sisyphus .
it 's a little like your reputation .
lesson number three : at@@ alan@@ ta .
greatest runner . she would challenge anybody .
if you lost , you died .
how did hipp@@ omen@@ es beat her ?
and we 've had some fantastic presentations .
i never will forget it .
i will never forget it .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i was devastated .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
it 's interesting to me .
and there is this stunning silence .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the only country in the world .
and that 's a very sensible question .
i mean , it 's fascinating .
i mean , it 's fascinating .
it 's not our problem .
it 's not our burden .
it 's not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these issues .
they had to worry about being bombed .
and i thought about that .
i could n't bear it .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
it will get to you .
and i began giving her my rap .
we 're trying to reduce the prison population .
i do n't believe that .
i sometimes push too hard .
you should ask for some of that .
and he whispered in my ear .
i had written these crazy things .
he kept pacing back and forth .
you 're an inspiring person .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
it 's gone . it 's vanished .
we van@@ qui@@ shed it . puff .
not even the truth will set them free .
same thing , only bigger .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
and it just disturbed me so much .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
you know , you can choose your list .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
do n't take anything for granted .
because , did anyone have measles here ?
his name is paul off@@ it .
and he actually says it that way .
so , paul 's a terrorist .
we have measles in this country now .
no one 's ever said that before .
the data says it all the time .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- dark urine . dark .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it makes them feel good . "
and you know what ? you 're wrong .
there are . there always are .
you do n't want to do that ?
we object to genetically engineered food .
you know science is n't a company .
it 's not a country .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
it 's kind of like a potato .
because , you know something ?
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
i mean , it 's quite brutal .
there are nine billion humans coming our way .
it felt like a revolution .
and third , you need desire .
the dance community is now global .
that 's a lot of light .
also , the system is self-@@ fueling .
but you can publish your stuff online .
we 're getting great talks back from them .
okay , step back a minute .
we 're a social species .
we spark off each other .
suddenly , here we are .
he 's a unic@@ y@@ cli@@ st .
why do people like watching tedtalks ?
now , this is big .
our future is man@@ y-@@ to-@@ many .
that changes everything , right ?
there 's a self-help group .
we have our own film school .
-lrb- applause -rrb- ca : you know what ?
and this made me really sad .
they stopped us from being inspired .
it can know where we are .
but what are we doing with it ?
and it opens up a map .
we 're harnessing energy from the sun .
you see , we also have the technology .
and so suddenly they 're looking at me .
so this piece is about a negative imagination .
and then he put her in the hallway .
" the next morning she was dead .
" ok . ok ? ok . ok .
and this is called " toughness . "
see again , the diversity .
this is scrolling up the east coast .
this is visualizing international communications .
so now on to something completely different .
some of you may recognize this .
i was probably being a little extreme .
so i created this drawing tool .
and i started collecting sheep .
he draws sheep after sheep .
this is again showing all the different contributions .
you may recognize these two guys .
so we re@@ synthesized this song .
this is what that sounded like .
you 'd be fed a simple audio clip .
so basically motion through 3d space .
so we did exactly that .
and people were making some amazing things .
one is the beginning of the music video .
you 're hearing a person 's life .
but there 's a bunch of different styles .
-lrb- applause -rrb- now let 's get started .
the science is that simple .
we need to think about the problem differently .
i 'm talking about the production of aluminum .
volta 's battery works at room temperature .
i 'll show you how .
so now , how to choose the metals ?
and that includes our own bodies .
magnesium for the top layer .
and antimony for the bottom layer .
and then we reverse the current .
so what to do next ?
i called it the shot@@ glass .
and we got the same remarkable results .
we call that the pizza .
so what have we learned from all this ?
they lie beyond the visible .
let me give you one example of this .
it 's a tiny , tiny thing .
okay , you simply would n't .
and yet , it never happens .
but there 's a fourth thing .
we do n't know what to call it .
i resolved to give back .
we need to accelerate these shifts .
and my story is about these trade@@ offs .
what will this future without secrets look like ?
transparency can be mis@@ directed .
it makes sense , right ?
but then we added the misdirection .
we can browse the internet anonymously .
they 're happy . they are satisfied .
so , let 's start off in china .
let me take you to the real china .
she went to high school .
she went to vocational school for accounting .
she sent money back to her family .
what we saw was a natural experiment .
the village became a real stand@@ out .
in the 19th century , it was slavery .
okay , most of you .
you need to use scarce resources .
do you think we 'll make it ? "
so here is bill of arabia .
let me tell you about maha@@ buba .
in a word , she st@@ ank .
she fought off the hyenas with that stick .
let me tell you about saima .
and at the time , she was miserable .
so now they 're in it together .
let me tell you about beatrice bi@@ ira .
hei@@ fer sent two goats to africa .
the twins started producing milk .
he sort of mu@@ mbled .
i will just leave you with two things .
what that was was a bird feeder .
so , here 's the cause .
now , that 's the good news .
unfortunately , it 's not .
you sort of place your bets .
well , what does this really look like ?
how can we make this go faster ?
that picture you see there ?
that 's the good news .
i want to tell you about another disorder .
that could be a phenomenal , valuable activity .
are those cells happy or not ?
we are in a remarkable moment here .
i hope that 's your goal .
i started my own experiments .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you !
so i go on television .
it 's totally almost just like that .
the hate mail i get is unbelievable .
let me give you a small example .
you 'd totally be surprised .
political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct .
now here 's the kicker .
i 'm not saying it 's easy .
but what do we do for a living ?
and everyone said it was impossible .
it is a moment in time .
i have a better mouse@@ trap .
i call it the idea of tribes .
you 've got the organized armies over here .
he did it by creating a movement .
but let me just try a couple .
the beatles did not invent teenagers .
they merely decided to lead them .
we need to organize around it . "
it 's exactly the same behavior though .
so three questions i 'd offer you .
they challenge what 's currently there .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
why do we need to study this anymore ?
it is a voice of experience .
so my parents would go to dinner .
and it was sno@@ wing that day .
and that 's a belief that i share .
my other great passion is the environment .
i was considered a radical .
so what 's going to solve this ?
so let 's get started now .
it has an intact hindu culture .
cynthia and i were there .
we decided to give back locally .
the teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard .
the desks are not square .
they 're beautiful . they 're bamboo .
they know they can control their world .
and you know what these are .
there is n't enough water .
not many things did n't work .
i asked him , " why ? "
it 's becoming a green model .
no petrochemicals in the pavement .
these are volcanic stones laid by hand .
this is the school buffalo .
we dropped them gently in .
the kids are from 25 countries .
but you also learn other things .
you practice ancient balinese arts .
the mothers are n't quite convinced .
and all the kids are thriving .
and how did we do all this ?
it 's a double helix .
so we built big models .
we had them engineered by the engineers .
is this doable in your community ?
it 's a model we built for bali .
so , mr. gore , thank you .
so , that 's home really .
capital , malé , where i live .
high pressure builds over india .
and the whole system goes into reverse .
they lay the eggs into fresh water .
so , they 're very important .
it really does need fresh water .
but this guy is an exception .
it 's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly .
so , maldives , beautiful place .
so , it stays under the soil .
the trees can put their roots into it .
but dragonflies - a bit tricky .
are they coming from india against the wind ?
maldives is a long archipelago .
when do you see the dragonflies appear ?
and pretty soon , a picture started emerging .
then malé , then further south .
and then the sou@@ ther@@ nmost maldives .
how on earth are they doing that ?
i had a rigorous scientific tran@@ sect .
that 's not the southwest season .
i can be in the southwest monsoon .
what on earth are they doing ?
the larvae have to develop very quickly .
they 're up , and they 're off .
they ha@@ tched out in india .
this is a summer monsoon .
a complete circuit of the indian ocean .
there is more to the story .
so , siberia , man@@ ch@@ uri@@ a .
and that 's where it breeds .
but then the being sensible stopped .
no , they turn across here .
it comes with the mon@@ so@@ ons .
they make use of exactly the same winds .
same height as the dragonflies go .
so , they are using the same winds .
it so happens that these weapons are dangerous .
this issue is n't just theoretical .
so there 's good news .
and i will take kenya as an example .
here you see the data .
what is the origin of the data ?
we have interviews , we have surveys .
how many children did you have ?
but they have good quality .
so this is a limitation .
and when the experts in the u.n.
we have a decent trend .
we got , later , the mosquito netting .
an economist would never do that .
i have just divided it into two periods .
here we have -lsb- the -rsb- year .
that 's where we are today .
my ancestors moved to the united states .
and is n't it a success story .
here we have a problem .
the dark blue here is sub-saharan africa .
welcome to a decent life .
come on . we want everyone down there .
let 's be clear about that .
all this is possible with your mobile phone .
and i will talk about this .
and why are these informa@@ tions there ?
who sends whom a text message ?
every time i use my mobile phone ?
i want to make them public .
you can see every step i take .
all this is possible with this information .
that 's a little bit scary .
it 's about all of us .
you can see all of this .
so case closed , right ?
and this can take quite a while .
and they started settling out .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- but they settled .
now why ? you can call them .
patents are very difficult to over@@ turn .
so what does all this mean ?
and what do they do with that money ?
it 's from the senate .
we do n't really like to only consume .
that was the level of rhetoric .
so they went for plan b.
so pipa and sopa are round two .
that 's the easy thing .
that 's the simple thing .
they just want the sharing to go away .
that 's the way to handle this .
that marriage lasted for a year .
these epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses .
these canopy communities are fragile .
the results have been fantastic .
i 'll just give you a few examples .
so this whole industry is unsustainable .
and they have become excellent partners .
the best i can imagine .
i have 13 minutes with each patient .
but the truth is i was devastated .
they will be used for our purposes .
so that 's where health leads began .
do you have safe housing ? "
and we gave it a shot .
health just takes more time .
now in the top 10 cities in the u.s.
do they have insurance to fill the prescription ?
you must pursue that vision . "
that 's a lot of pressure . "
no , no , no .
and let me show you something else .
the cards were bigger than my hands .
nothing to do with golf .
they have to be precisely la@@ thed .
but i could not understand .
the clubs were escaping me at each throw .
so i proudly showed him my clubs .
they are impossible to juggle . "
it was more interesting ; i heard .
so i cut one rope off .
and the next day one rope off .
but nobody wanted to hire me .
manhattan no longer spreads its infinity .
i step over the beam .
but it is too late .
well i did n't have that problem .
you know that , right ?
each time i street juggle i use improvisation .
now comes the day of the walk .
i stop in the middle .
i make the dove appear .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and people scream .
what a genius , what a professional .
and the entire valley goes crazy .
he did n't know the true story .
by inspiring ourselves we inspire others .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you . thank you .
i 'd like to begin with four questions .
i hope you notice the coincidence here .
we were about 11,000 people living here .
resources were n't there to develop them .
most people died around the age of 50 .
1939 , that 's when they discovered oil .
people started to get to know each other .
so what 's the population today ?
that is in less than 60 years .
lifespan has increased to 78 .
and this is amongst the highest worldwide .
how could we survive that ?
so what are the risks ?
there 's also changing diets .
so we also face risks .
is there a sustainable solution ?
a deple@@ table energy ? fossil fuel ?
or should we use something else ?
and that is a lot of water .
without it we ca n't do anything .
this is a person going for a walk .
i call these eight characters radicals .
three trees together , we create the forest .
two suns together , prosperous .
three together , that 's spar@@ kles .
on the left , we have a woman .
two women together , they have an argument .
so we have gone through almost 30 characters .
nowadays , exile has turned into getting out .
all easier said than done .
half of them gave over the internet .
we just re@@ organized the markets .
so we 're trying to do that .
and so we have set about doing that .
thank you and god bless you .
he certainly does n't look like me .
his name is matthieu ri@@ card .
but fun is not enough .
what if compassion is also profitable ?
that would create the conditions for world peace .
google is a company born of idealism .
it 's sort of a funny pattern .
and let me give you some examples .
there are also real business benefits .
there are three components of compassion .
it makes us a highly effective company .
the second ingredient is autonomy .
it works in three steps .
what does that mean ? imagine this .
i want you to be happy . "
imagine you can do that .
take nothing : do no harm .
it 's axi@@ omatic . why not us ?
so the equation is conceptual .
linear : take , make , waste .
powered by fossil fuel-@@ derived energy .
more carpet per man-@@ hour .
we call it cool carpet .
we call this mission zero .
and the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
it is a better business model .
we literally gained market share .
i do n't think so .
and now the challenge is in execution .
please meet " tomorrow 's child . "
a wise friend introduced us two .
knowing you has changed my thinking .
for you , it 's your call .
the memory is this bit over here .
you see it all like this .
of course , it 's this big .
completely mechanical . this whole machine is mechanical .
now , he needed accessories .
obviously , you 've got a computer now .
you also need graphics , right ?
babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics .
turing 's machine was entirely theoretical .
there is in a sense a computing essence .
it did have a ram pack .
what does this all mean for us ?
but we want to use our brain !
here is an example of our aerial camera .
in addition , it 's multi-@@ spectral .
extract geometry from the images .
this process is a very calculated process .
we think about the user interface .
i thank you very much for your time .
children do n't like it .
or the distant peel of thunder ?
the illusion of speech follows incidentally .
and this is the plot behind stuxnet .
so we start with a windows dropper .
that 's easy , huh ?
and that worked pretty well .
and it even got better .
that 's cool , huh ?
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
think about this : this attack is generic .
just spread it as wide as possible .
this is the blood vessels .
they 're probably less cell dense .
and each neuron itself is largely unique .
we each have 23 pairs of chromosomes .
they 're encoded in the dna .
we were seeking normal human brains .
we are seeking normal human brains .
and remember , it 's frozen .
we take a microscope slide .
this is a more detailed map .
so the technician takes the instructions .
they scribe along a place there .
and then the laser actually cuts .
and each gene gives us a fingerprint .
so what can scientists learn about this data ?
these are commonly prescribed antidepressants .
now remember , we 're as@@ saying genes .
proteins are targets for drugs .
we can see this unique fingerprint .
we 're similar at the genetic level .
now what do those differences look like ?
i think these resources are incredibly valuable .
crazy , i know . insane .
he said , " be happy .
an infection ravaged my skin .
he said it would kill me .
and some of us might even sing .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you so much .
this is some life-support equipment closed-@@ cycle .
to experience it is a privilege .
you need a melt probe .
no hands at the wheel .
what then of manned space exploration ?
go , go , go .
it 's not going to look like that .
anybody drink one of these here this week ?
we can go much further .
it has never been done .
i intend to lead that expedition .
we have collectively forgotten that lesson .
politicians have recently begun twittering .
another is via the api .
for example : " evan williams . "
what does that even mean ?
what makes the heart unique ?
what else do we know about the heart ?
let 's take the example of electrical stimulation .
and after one week , it 's beating .
what does this mean for us ?
let 's do something really simple .
there 's nothing done to this image .
congratulations . you have now completed setup .
tamara , would you like to jump in ?
child : oh , that is so cool .
second child : it 's magic .
tamara , are you recording ?
okay , so are you all ready ?
one , two , three . go !
audience : who@@ oo@@ oo@@ oo !
it 's completely free to download this application .
this guy 's name is tempt .
and that was the onset of als .
so tempt is now completely paralyzed .
he only has use of his eyes .
so that started the journey .
-lrb- applause -rrb- which was awesome .
we 've won a bunch of awards .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
here they are : the earth is full .
we ca n't stop economic growth .
we can surely sort this out .
well , it 's mostly true .
we need it to develop technology .
and that 's what will happen to us .
we 're not even slowing down .
i 've done my grieving about the loss .
i accept where we are .
so when does this transition begin ?
i want to talk to you about fear .
the crisis is now inevitable .
this issue is , how will we react ?
the future is inherently uncertain .
we can do it at an affordable cost .
this could be our finest hour .
i 'll explain at another time .
i hope , i believe .
and that really , really excites me .
political , economic , psychological , whatever .
band aid , live aid .
the children had a name for me .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- do n't ask .
it was the middle of that awful famine .
the right to live like a human .
the right to live , period .
this is about justice . really .
africa is a continent in flames .
they 're attempting to bring order to chaos .
well , why are n't we ?
does n't compassion look well on us ?
the neon sign is fi@@ zzing and cracking .
the regional branch managers are getting nervous .
our values : do we have any ?
as a person who buys the products .
more anti-@@ retrovirals make sense .
well , much more than we think .
it is not a theory .
they 've done incredible stuff , unbelievable stuff .
this is what excites me .
most of you did , the digital world .
i do not have flowers in my hair .
actually , i come from punk rock .
but i know toughness when i see it .
we 're calling it the one campaign .
we believe this is one .
there 's the continent africa .
but there 's also our sense of ourselves .
people are starting to figure this out .
the war against terror , yes .
-lrb- applause -rrb- okay , my three wishes .
the ones that ted has offered to grant .
anyway , here 's number one .
that is my first wish .
i believe it 's possible .
you know , there 's lots out there .
that 's one billion media hits .
every three seconds one person dies .
another three seconds , one more .
but we need your help .
americans have an unprecedented opportunity .
please visit one at this address .
and i would like it to be ethiopia .
that is my wish , my third wish .
i think it 's possible .
but it did n't start out that way .
since then , not that much has changed .
but wireless technology was n't dreamt up then .
so we have this kind of dual nature .
now these are my comrades in arms .
is london a great big whale ?
is microsoft a great big anth@@ ill ?
what do we learn from that ?
all companies die , all companies .
so is that just another version of this ?
well we understand this very well .
we 're all pretty much the same .
this is what we believe .
okay , so how do we understand this ?
so let 's first talk about biology .
something else is going on .
and here 's the point of that .
there is an extraordinary regularity .
and you 're very familiar with these networks .
here 's just a symbolic picture of that .
and here 's scaling of cities .
the slope of that is less than linear .
there is an economy of scale .
but here 's what 's surprising .
and here , they 're all plotted together .
and here 's the statement .
what is the reason for this ?
something universal is going on .
lastly , i want to talk about growth .
see companies , they scale .
it 's the same plot .
that red line is from the theory .
and this is what this exhibition looks at .
other people are not as elastic .
scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics .
another shape is made for cancer .
our democracies rely on elections .
without that mandate , they would be corrupt .
the ballot boxes go to counting places .
we have to trust a lot of procedures .
and that 's the tough part .
and the secret is the ballot form .
so this is how you vote .
and you sh@@ red the candidate list .
i still remember this decisive moment .
these words , they stuck with me .
my idea : we awa@@ ken this network .
" why do n't you try ? "
the engine is the spinal cord .
how could we re-@@ engage the engine ?
immediately , the paralyzed rat can stand .
this locomotion was completely involuntary .
clearly , the steering system was missing .
imagine , this is really cool .
in fact - -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
i mean , how is it possible ?
this is truly a trans-@@ disciplinary team .
me too , every day .
this is the africa of opportunity .
i want to tell you that .
so the market is there .
standard chartered has brought in 140 million .
so it 's clear that things are changing .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- for 10,000 pieces .
so i invite you to explore the opportunities .
you may remember these guys .
but they have been distracted recently .
we know how to fight it now .
who ended the global jihad ?
we do n't have to reinvent the wheel .
we 've got plenty of these things .
sometimes i used to walk more at night .
and so i was following this guy .
i do n't know where inspiration comes from .
i do n't get necessarily inspired by research .
i go back to color all the time .
color is something that motivates me a lot .
i was dating this guy , right ?
i do n't know how to put this .
i do work with different choreo@@ graphers .
and so i had this t.v. show .
i want to stay out of the way .
do you get nervous , ash@@ le@@ igh ?
ash@@ le@@ igh : doing what ?
rod : you like it ? all right .
rod : no , not me , no .
im : it looks good , yeah ?
im : oh , it 's so fabulous !
it 's , like , this website .
it 's a poly@@ mathematical website .
and here is the last bit .
im : it 's always low-fat buttermilk .
im : is that all it is ?
let me tell you something interesting .
im : yeah , exactly .
the liquid is actually that clear liquid .
im : yeah , it is , exactly .
so who would think that it was low-fat ?
they 've made a selection .
that 's because it 's cheaper .
they were able to create that .
they were able to create something wonderful .
this is happening by itself .
let 's see it one more time .
we go through initiation rites .
the ethnosphere is humanity 's great legacy .
let 's make it kogi . "
they spe@@ ared each other .
now , what does that mean ?
well , what does that mean ?
they 're hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
the second aspect is love .
and i just love this guy .
his career i admire a lot .
they are objects of desire .
they are imaginary musical instruments .
he took a leap of faith .
why has the record been so poor ?
try and build a political settlement first .
that will produce a legitimate and accountable government .
so that 's the conventional approach .
i think that approach denies reality .
and the risks stay high throughout the decade .
and the loser is un@@ reconc@@ iled .
why does the politics get easier ?
and why is it so difficult initially ?
and that does n't produce a productive politics .
the first actor is the security council .
it is a cost-effective approach .
the donors provide post-conflict aid .
they moved on to some other situation .
post-conflict economic recovery is a slow process .
you can do that quite fast .
it 's got to reform economic policy .
those are the three critical priorities .
and why are jobs so important ?
now , that is difficult .
that is not a good idea .
during conflict people are doing destruction .
what might the bottlenecks be ?
first you need access to land .
neither of those approaches is sensible .
clean means follow their money .
where would that leave us ?
i 'm a toy developer .
data , data , data .
you become sick of thinking .
it 's my dream to create new toys .
it 's the same in japanese and english .
how about a toy with cola ?
can we make a hat into a toy ?
think up many trivial ideas , everyone .
that 's the one you should choose .
you just have to choose words at random .
you would n't even realize it .
there are futures that are born from data .
so , what is simplicity ?
and that 's a simple question .
it 's like , what is simplicity ?
what is the state of science ?
the components interact with one another .
we 've heard from bill gates recently .
the answer is , not a lot .
anything else is more complicated .
and from that comes the internet .
so , for example , stones .
that is , you can stack them .
it just is not possible .
it 's a little paper chip .
you know , no power required .
this is by de sain@@ t-@@ exu@@ pery .
-lrb- applause -rrb- chris anderson : quick question .
ca : have you started to do that ?
gw : well , no .
how do i put that simply ? no .
you want to measure it by diversity ?
there 's bur@@ rowing birds .
now , my work began at the beginning .
if we could roll that first video clip .
and the kinds of teams they bring in ?
so , 125 degrees is normal .
that 's a 2,000 mile journey .
it 's really a wholly separate radiation .
we had to try and reconstruct this .
could i have the second little video clip ?
man : i got the back legs .
somebody get the front legs .
that 's a big skull .
man : i knew it was big .
one , two , three !
anyway , you find other things , too .
we found this last year .
two hundred skeletons , tools , jewelry .
this is a ceremon@@ ial disk .
it 's really an island continent .
we have down@@ graded this factor .
i want to give you three dimensions .
several teachers nearly killed me .
i found myself in art .
this is a very extraordinarily visual .
they 're really kin@@ dred disciplines .
dinosaurs was one of them .
these are two kids from project exploration .
and we created a track record .
so what 's happening here ?
it 's second nature to them .
the first is redistribution markets .
the second is collaborative lifestyles .
it 's a scheme in the u.k.
together they grow their own food .
it may even be your story .
he told me two things .
he needed them to feel protected .
and he was very , very sorry .
so i broke the silence .
i 'm still breaking the silence today .
talk about what you heard here .
abuse thrives only in silence .
this is a training ground .
social lines are barbed wire .
that 's my son , darius .
so that 's the personal reason .
that 's the humanitarian mission .
doctor : how many are these ?
patient : these are two things .
doctor : what are their shapes ?
doctor : what shape do you see here ?
patient : i ca n't make it out .
doctor : how many things are these ?
now , how many things are these ?
doctor : what are these things ?
patient : a square and a circle .
so that 's what we did .
-lrb- applause -rrb- i collaborate with bacteria .
we 're all very aware .
and rightly so , in many cases .
so this perspective is perhaps justified .
we 're making incremental progress .
and that 's really clear now .
we 've got to confront that reality .
that 's how all wealth is created .
only business can actually create resources .
but that profit is the magic .
business should be more responsible .
i 'm proud of that .
the classic example is pollution .
that 's been the conventional wisdom .
that 's a very simplistic view .
it makes the business more productive and efficient .
it does n't waste resources .
accidents are expensive and costly .
this is an example of jain irrigation .
it 's real . it 's happening .
i know it . i 'm seeing it .
they had a big patient population .
they divided them up into two groups .
now they measured one other variable .
it was the sense of efficacy .
it 's an amazing notion .
except , maybe we do .
and i do n't know if it works .
but it actually hits home .
the choice in this case is pretty simple .
your blood pressure might drop a little bit .
but we have an opportunity .
this is a pharmaceutical ad .
but it looks completely right .
there is no good faith in this .
so this is a different approach .
so let me just walk through this quickly .
they 're packed with information .
they go right to doctors .
this is our one-@@ page summary .
we use the notion of color .
why is wired magazine doing this ?
it should be the patient .
this is information that is incredibly powerful .
it 's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change .
and this information is out there .
but one thing is clear .
so the era of big infrastructure is over .
they really become nature 's wave attenu@@ ators .
many , many species depend on them .
so get your te@@ v@@ as on .
and then those spat are then seeded .
i get asked two questions about this project .
and that 's frightening . it 's terrifying .
and so we look for a way out .
now this did n't sound very plausible .
now , the first story is the simplest .
we would lose all of our market . "
and that 's that middle set of bars .
so , let me show you what happens .
they were almost impossible to swallow .
bottom right are the sex chromosomes .
well , everybody can throw around big numbers .
so it 's really quite big .
it 's called the beijing genomics institute .
what does this mean for medicine ?
so a woman is age 37 .
what they had was dop@@ a-@@ responsive dystonia .
that 's how fast this is moving .
consumer applications for genomics , they will flourish .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- personalized genomic massage anyone ?
and it looks really good .
now i think it 's too easy .
now what is atheism 2.0 ?
i ca n't believe in the doctrines .
i really like looking at old churches .
so that 's a sort of tough choice .
i think there is an alternative .
the secular world is full of holes .
that 's a lovely idea .
they asked themselves the following question .
and influential voices came up with one answer .
they wanted to replace scripture with culture .
and that 's a very plausible idea .
they see us as adults , rational adults .
we 're only just holding it together .
i 'm an independent , individual person . "
religions go , " nonsense .
otherwise our minds are like si@@ eves .
so religions are cultures of repetition .
we associate repetition with boredom .
all the major religions give us calendars .
now we do n't think that way .
i 'll just come across it . "
you 'll be handed rice cakes .
they tell us to have a bath .
we do n't tend to do that .
let 's look at art now .
you 've heard that saying .
i could n't disagree more .
and that 's what art is .
and they tend to be on their own .
and they do n't really change much .
what do organized religions do ?
they group together , they form institutions .
and that has all sorts of advantages .
these are all very good qualities .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
they 're selling us shoes and cars .
we need to group together .
and that 's what religions do .
that 's something we can learn from .
look very closely at pilgrimage .
there 's so much we can absorb .
pol@@ it@@ eness is a much-@@ overlooked virtue .
it 's seen as hypocrisy .
so it 's a wiki project .
well , this was the first solution .
january 7@@ 00@@ 3 . there it is .
ok , back to danny 's list .
then there 's the return .
something that 's just yours .
they do n't quite meet .
way more interesting than monterey even today .
and it 's a pretty interesting scene .
let 's go to approaches .
well , here 's a potential approach .
you need to come up the lincoln canyon .
how about zander 's cre@@ vice ? no .
one is the experience of the mountain .
another is the experience in the mountain .
it 's a very nice ranch .
and this stone takes a perfect polish .
it has three different kinds of strings .
and the third string is pretty innovative .
and it 's very difficult to tune .
we also refer to subclinical conditions .
season follows the pre-@@ season .
we 've medicalized everything in this country .
strike one is when you hit puberty .
that 's been medicalized as well .
strike three is menopa@@ use .
so , just take a moment .
it 's called pre-@@ death .
i made up pre-@@ death .
good morning . my name is david rose .
and there are obviously all kinds of things .
now , how do you do this ?
you 've got to convey passion .
i do n't know who the players are .
so you 've got to know your market .
you 've got to know your area .
so what else do you require ?
i want to know that you have commitment .
you 've got to have vision .
you need to be co@@ ac@@ hable .
we 've had a lot of experience .
so think about your pitch as a timeline .
okay , so how do you do that ?
you want a nice logical progression .
start with telling them what the market is .
so this all feeds in together .
bill gates ' powerpoint presentation over here .
here 's gates doing a thing for windows .
yes ? ok , steve jobs .
what are you focusing on ?
the long bullet points are bad .
and why this whole thing makes sense .
i do n't need all that .
no , never do a live demo .
but then , everybody has competition .
you 're making x amount per widget .
i want to know what the driver is .
but then comes the ask .
i hope you invested personally .
because i 'm following on .
just your logo on the screen .
what do you think i 'm looking at ?
you think that i 'm looking at that ?
number four : always use remote control .
because i 'm using remote control over here .
number three : do n't read your speech .
so most everyone watches tv .
we 're talking about popular tv .
we love to watch tv .
did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
did you feel outrage ? did you laugh ?
what did this mean for you ?
that 's what we 're watching tv for .
moral ambiguity starts to climb .
in 1970 , inspiration plumme@@ ts .
it can make me feel this ?
" dallas , " " fantasy island . "
everything 's good , low unemployment .
look what happens when we keep going .
what do people want in their tv then ?
no , they want judgment .
that 's all great , right ?
ja : even on the coldest winter days .
dr : i like that word .
we gave the office a few days off .
they moved to an abandoned school .
and i sat in on several meetings .
the city actually approached us .
there needed to be a foundation in place .
and we just felt it had to happen .
it 's all incredibly humble material .
it 's scaffolding and plywood .
and that 's what we were interested in .
it enables that conversation to get serious .
this shows saint paul 's on the left .
dr : it was an honor to do .
well , so says george w. bush .
other people would say it means something else .
that 's an academic question .
because they would have done extraordinarily well .
now what would that look like ?
it will be transformative of islam as well .
so the risks are very great .
i 've been studying robots ever since .
we called it the tele-actor .
and we go through this several rounds .
it 's getting pretty close to finished now .
i 'll inflate them kind of large .
and i can see how it might dance .
mortality : 300,000 people dying each year .
then , look at that after three minutes .
and computers do n't go to sleep .
what does the system look like ?
it 's implanted with very conventional techniques .
finally , you go to the emergency room .
that 's what we have discovered .
this is what an aura looks like .
this is probably a better picture .
that is the first wish .
well , that 's the good news .
and that is the second wish .
and that is one of the ideas .
these are just some starting points .
he triggered the modernist revolution .
and we saw this guy , hai@@ bao .
china symbolized by the dragon .
copenhagen , shanghai , modern , european .
bicycles have become forbidden many places .
we donate 1,000 bikes to shanghai .
this is our first architectural model .
this is an aerial photo taken last summer .
and essentially , the apartments cover the parking .
they are access@@ ed through this diagonal elevator .
they can actually have both .
so we took the commission .
we quite often make little movies .
they create shelter from the wind .
they accumulate the solar energy .
we found this one last year .
this explains most contemporary political debates .
and this is continuing and continuing and continuing .
he was darwin 's cousin .
and he gave a wonderful technical talk .
he 's a professor at mit .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- just a thought .
because these technologies are moving really quickly .
here 's what it looks like in 2000 .
i do n't have a good answer .
a second option is the sexy geek option .
these conditions are highly rare .
the third , is this too much information ?
or maybe it 's chemicals .
and again , do people like the outcome ?
ken living@@ stone was re@@ elected .
this is my big vision .
i 'm going to give you some examples .
what are the incredible weaknesses ?
how do we create a big network ?
we should pull it forward .
we have this incredible excess capacity .
who knew about extension managers ?
i decided to go with the latter .
i 'm going to talk about rome .
rome is a city full of surprises .
over the spanish steps we go .
so they all have his number .
so it becomes slightly three-dimensional .
here 's a book completely wide open .
people are learning more things about it .
we see almost no change in sexual behavior .
people really like to have sex .
so that 's what this figure shows you .
we have no consistent testing .
it 's been widely heralded .
and this routine went on for some time .
and i would like to share my art .
first principles , this is very important .
the problem is hydro@@ dynamics .
the arm is extended below the head .
here is an example of the stroke .
not their fault , honestly .
and that will get you very far .
languages . material versus method .
i arrived in tokyo . amazing .
and so it came to me in waves .
and that 's pretty much my response .
you can also do this with grammar .
and now i love languages .
and so i ended up walking like this .
not very good for ballroom dancing .
secondly , different types of pivo@@ ts .
thirdly , variation in tempo .
i 'm going to jump forward here .
his name is gabriel mis@@ se .
that 's just one benefit of that .
so then we broke it down .
this would be an example of one pivot .
this is a back step pivot .
there are many different types .
apply them to very big dreams .
there was gas ra@@ tioning in 1973 .
the energy crisis was in full bore .
but they did n't believe me .
first , the cour@@ sework at caltech .
so what about making energy ?
maybe we could make energy .
so , that 's a breakthrough .
traditionally , concentr@@ ators look like this .
and this is the shape that evolved .
we needed to beat solar cells .
we applied the genetic algorithm .
the exact converse is also true .
so now you put the two things together .
it does n't really care .
and you also get hot water .
the hot water 's optional .
this is the map of the united states .
and of course , look at africa .
it just makes economic sense .
and that 's what it 's about .
so , how do we do that ?
now , i had two pre@@ conditions .
one was that they be american .
and why did i do that ?
but i wanted interviews that were different .
i did n't know it coming into it .
who makes a great interview in this context ?
these were people through their 90s .
so she and i had a delightful conversation .
she was in a great evening gown .
now i 'm her competitor for the audience .
just with@@ ering in her contempt .
again , a remarkable person .
she stayed in her room .
and i asked him one question .
du@@ mas mal@@ one was from mississippi originally .
this was to agnes de mil@@ le .
she lived in new york .
so , let me start projecting forward .
and that 's what you see here .
and that 's when we got the internet .
i made a stacking board .
real invention is happening in these labs .
so i 'm going to talk about it .
everybody knew that , for generations .
this is not something i 've made up .
you 've believed it through generations .
so that is what they have done now .
it 's what we ought to be doing .
and we just record what we see . "
charles darwin must be spinning in his grave !
he knew all about that kind of science .
and he called it hypothe@@ si@@ s-free science .
there was one waiting in the wings .
you 've exposed us to public ridicule !
you must never do that again . "
well i do n't think that .
and take bi@@ ped@@ ality .
do you think that 's significant ?
the question of why we can speak .
i do n't believe it .
it 's never been done .
everybody likes the aquatic theory .
some of them have come over .
anybody else out there ? come on in .
that would be very sad .
no sign of that happening either .
that would be a beautiful thing .
i can tell you that in three words .
the textbooks do n't mention it .
i 'll go along with that too .
and that was only the beginning .
we are playing with fire .
so the conversation began at bennington .
but so does the importance of content .
we actually do it all the time .
that is where you come in .
start with those , and change the world .
one , they 're infantry .
michael moriarty : specialist michael moriarty .
man down ! man down !
mm : i will not go back .
paul ? come on , stand up .
right ? and we started talking .
if we could roll the clip .
it 's not true . very unsafe .
soldiers : get your vest on !
any one-@@ four elements get to the gate !
soldier : i 'll walk you through it .
this is the scene north .
sp : we made the news .
another mission at 0@@ 6@@ :00 .
five soldiers filmed the entire time .
and for me , i really wanted that .
ok , this is a perfect example .
there 's such a disconnect .
i 'll share one story .
or you know , these things .
he 's a big guy .
and he was n't going to blink .
kids got too close , very often .
you go and see anybody ?
are you a friend to them ?
and really do give them a hug .
-lrb- music -rrb- text : beat@@ jazz .
that 's the metaphor , the old metaphor .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- age as pathology .
how do we live it successfully ?
this potential is not for the lucky few .
i thought , oh my gosh .
i have such a powerful feeling of well-being .
some of it is a matter of luck .
some of it , obviously , is genetic .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- myself included .
as i diminished , i grew .
perhaps our parents suffered from depression .
how was i supposed to live it ?
how did they treat my parents ?
it 's like re@@ setting a thermostat .
women start off whole , do n't we ?
we are the subjects of our own lives .
and i was permanently hooked .
now this society has no central authority .
so bees have social healthcare .
it 's a natural antibiotic .
and then there 's pesticides .
you 've probably heard about it .
this is a new class of insecticides .
let me put this all together for you .
and it 's not just our honeybees .
we need all of our bees .
and we need to diversify our farms .
on behalf of the bees , thank you .
maria spi@@ va@@ k : yeah .
so it 's getting pre@@ cari@@ ous .
and i 've stuck to that .
what 's really going on ?
subsistence farming is drying up basically .
people are following opportunity into town .
there is plenty going on .
they even build their own infrastructure .
and then gradually gent@@ ri@@ fies .
and that 's how they work .
and this is where we can help .
and the nations they 're in can help .
you look at that lane on the right .
the answer is , " everything . "
and the scale is terrific .
there 's all kinds of activity .
the immediately have fewer children .
and they are regi@@ onally separated .
that 's what drought does .
shift to the power situation .
this is good for the atmosphere .
it 's good for their prosperity .
they 're typically buried in the ground .
and the innovation is moving very rapidly .
this is a moral issue .
this is a list of them .
so here is where we are .
i had to do something .
this fishing village was famous for sculpture .
so we had to create one .
now it had a sense of place .
its shape was too complex now .
so we had to create it .
my artistic horizons continue to grow .
i 'll leave you with this story .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you . thank you .
just have a look at the plants .
by the way , they are hungry always .
here we can see the damage .
here we are not talking about a predator .
but this is the end result .
the birth is almost complete .
and again , in action .
everything is just fine under these circumstances .
what we do is actually this .
i have one gram of those predatory mites .
and what is the impact ?
so the impact is very strong .
and thirdly , public demand .
so there is a huge gap to bridge .
so actually , how can we do it ?
and this gap really nar@@ rows .
step by step , it does narrow .
for one thing , both were very real .
these are community affairs , by the way .
and they did n't plan right .
it 's not a specific thing .
all the streets had to be torn up .
and they 're tearing up all the streets .
and you 'd plug it in there .
and it would clean your clothes .
and this was a big deal .
my mom hates this picture .
who has a computer ? yeah .
i mean , this was great .
and i was really good at school .
a very difficult time , actually .
and this is in 1993 .
they were saying , make it stop now .
and i said , never .
so , this happened in 1993 .
it 's put inside the computer .
this guy was my kind of like mentor .
he was such an inspirational guy .
he went into a coma .
so , naomi was pivotal in that .
this is all at the same time .
the computer lives in so many dimensions .
you get it ? no ? o.k.
it did n't make any sense .
i made this series of works .
the world is just so tasty .
no , they 're all out there .
we all are creative people .
we have this gene defect in our mind .
this is from the cape last year .
some rocks are twins separated at birth .
this is also out there , you know .
i brought you guys together again .
and i went after it with passion .
who 's a risd al@@ um out there ?
so , thank you everyone .
first , just a little bit about me .
we 're warming the climate .
and they can handle water .
they are very hardworking people .
these are the things that you can see .
what 's going on underwater ?
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
he has no book@@ ings left .
their numbers have never recovered .
these tuna swim the entire ocean .
and they pop@@ ulate much larger areas .
the biological effects are certainly hemi@@ spheric .
here are shrimp boats employed .
all they 're doing is stirring it .
so it 's a continued fight .
it 's a historic moment right now .
now are we stuck with this ?
who says it 's too expensive ?
people who sell us fossil fuels .
energy is always a moral issue .
the stories started pouring out .
what does the macro-@@ data show us ?
they 're threatened with a legal claim .
neither in sacramento nor in washington .
and so the state can come in .
we 've forgotten that second part .
so , how do we rebuild it ?
life is too complex for ...
and so here is the fourth proposition .
the constitution is only 16 pages long .
and how do you make it simple ?
that person does n't exist today .
this is the hardest hurdle .
goldman sachs projected 20@@ 27 .
the post-@@ crisis projection is 2020 .
that 's just a decade away .
it 's never been the case .
and what does it mean ?
i 'll give you two quick ones .
one country , two systems .
we were wrong . why were we wrong ?
think of german unification , 1990 .
one nation , one system .
that is the nation-state mentality .
the chinese do n't feel like that .
it 's had no serious rivals .
the state is everywhere in china .
it 's kind of arrogant .
and secondly , it 's ignorant .
and there are two consequences of this .
when did that last happen ?
take the 19th century , for example .
i think they 're playing golf .
welcome to the future . thank you .
the fact is - uh-@@ uh .
and we 've accomplished close to zip .
but in fact , they 're growing faster .
cheap meaning a few percent of gdp .
instead , we spend our time talking .
and there 's no adap@@ tion .
so this problem is absolutely soluble .
the result of that was pretty dramatic .
there 's no big mystery about it .
but it clearly cools down .
and one other thing : it 's fast .
and the answer seems to be yes .
the one new thing is this essay .
now , suppose that space aliens arrived .
and the box has two knobs .
we have no global governance .
but we 're building that box .
we need a broader debate .
and that calculation is n't much in dispute .
that 's an absolutely possible scenario .
but there is a problem with that view .
should we do serious research on this topic ?
but i have a lot of reservations .
that 's all there is to it .
let me show you how they work .
the bricks are color-@@ coded .
and it 's been an incredible experience .
so go ahead and start inventing .
let me just give you one example .
some use and advocate violence .
we have to be here . "
an afghan prosecutor has been assassinated .
it 's the child that 's remembered .
i call these creatures sunflowers .
they look like , maybe like sunflowers .
that would be a fun thing to do .
that 's sterilizing equipment in nigeria .
you remember all that oil ?
and that 's my specialty , right ?
and believe me , these are current pictures .
so , these are the problems .
does he look like he 's happy ?
we get a lot of donated equipment .
and we were doing open-heart surgery .
have you seen one of those before ?
this picture was taken last year .
i had four phases to this plan .
here 's how the dots connected .
it really is his name .
we 've started in our region .
here 's some images of that .
so it was evolving upwards .
a little indul@@ gent , i understand .
and they 're not all bad .
not authorized , but not illegal .
very similar communities , very similar .
we 've all had some degree of fame .
it 's like , it 's dis@@ orienting .
rm : you 'll get a text .
and it 's true . it 's true .
that 's over 50 percent .
it 's a really good thing .
well , we had a lot of them .
it 's an extraordinarily toxic thing .
it 's really going to be ok . "
its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold .
and here 's the really important point .
well this was really cool .
av : we , or i ?
rg : i 'm sorry .
misuse of the pron@@ ou@@ n .
and this was all quite remarkable .
you love , or you do n't love .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- rg : cruel .
so it was a very difficult time .
there 's something missing from these studies .
it ca n't possibly be that bad .
so i 'm not going to go .
can we move that up a little bit ?
rg + av : thank you .
it 's a very large number of galaxies .
you see the whole big picture ?
and there 's some spectacular things .
suppose you 're the cosmic designer .
it 's called dark matter .
so i 'll show you the next movie .
so we live in the bo@@ on@@ ies .
a par@@ sec is 3.@@ 26 light years .
so they 're simple building blocks .
so here 's that same end result .
that 's the issue , right ?
and so here we are .
at the beginning it 's very uniform .
and that 's a huge amount of data .
could you create the ultimate tedtalk ?
how should you deliver your talk ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- now , while ...
i 'll give you three examples .
you 'll all stay with me .
color plays a very important role .
and i call this tool the ted@@ pad .
now i hope you enjoy the session .
but he did n't have wikipedia .
i had maybe nine months .
and there it is on the shelves .
so the wires were un@@ insul@@ ated .
and they said , " absolutely not . "
and they thought about it all night .
and they decided to do it .
i wanted a better education .
a lot of our students get into theater .
quite frankly , you 're talking about americans .
we need to strengthen k-12 .
i know . i know . i know .
number one : high expectations .
he re@@ took the course .
he now works at harvard .
there was fire in that belly .
they were looking at this amazing protein design .
give him a big hand for that .
it 's called academic innovation .
and what does all of that mean ?
thank you all very much .
it 's a pretty accurate description .
we will see 30,000 new infected websites .
turns out that 's not cool .
this is a little usb key .
malware is very boring otherwise .
we can access your documents , your data .
that can be very embarrassing .
it creates some very serious al@@ erts .
we really should clean that up .
so let 's take this a little further .
and our cybercriminals had done the same thing .
they were working on the third floor .
ci@@ as@@ ur@@ ve@@ il@@ lance@@ van .
let 's talk about you .
would someone be able to abuse it ? "
find these resources . apply them .
i did n't look the part .
so , fast forward a few years .
question number two : how do you sleep ?
with my eyes shut . ha@@ -@@ ha .
that 's a bad day at the office .
and finally : am i crazy ?
it pretty much covers half the planet .
i tried to tell them to go away .
fortunately , help was at hand .
they were going very slowly .
and then that story changed .
anything that we do spreads ripples .
that 's just one example .
this is a world-@@ wide community .
and i suppose i 'm a selfish environmentalist .
his name was nikola , nikola tesla .
tree . chair . girl .
probably a form of synesthesia .
only then do i construct it .
it is the magic of science .
but tesla 's success did n't last .
nt : i had bigger ideas .
illuminating the city was only the beginning .
he became a re@@ cl@@ use .
his legacy is with us still .
tesla 's insight was profound .
mt : tesla thought he had the answer .
we are still asking the question .
the 0.1 percent in the u.s.
so what 's not to like ?
well , a few things .
we created the modern welfare state .
we created public health care .
we created public pen@@ sions .
we need a new new deal .
here is a letter of friendly advice .
adults , on the whole , are solemn .
perfection happens during solemn play .
it 's great to be a kid .
i still work for the public theater .
new yorkers look at their feet .
and it was serious play .
and then , inexpensive signage .
it 's a performing arts school .
and that began to make it solemn .
i keep that for evidence .
this is manhattan , one from the series .
and then this funny thing happened .
i 'm an igno@@ stic .
gas , you ca n't see that .
did n't catch on , unfortunately .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- but well done , him .
electricity , you ca n't see that .
radio : it actually flew . yes .
radio 2 : that was gorgeous .
radio : what did you think of that ?
and mobility to your destination is clearly solved .
it also continues to be a fabulous adventure .
' my world ' is subjective .
it 's emotional . it 's personal .
it 's the myth that we live in .
that 's what he heard .
" what should you not be ?
he heard a very different story .
bhar@@ at also conquered the world .
this was the mythology of the gymnosophist .
they were two lifetimes of the same hero .
when ram dies , krishna is born .
you go to and fr@@ o endlessly .
it was called the va@@ it@@ ar@@ ani .
you go again and again and again .
you dun@@ k it in the river .
because it has to end .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- two different mytho@@ logies .
one linear , one cyclical .
it 's always about my taste .
it 's about conversation and faith .
and people are okay with it .
and then globalization is taking place .
i love mythology too much .
and i worked in the healthcare industry .
but belief is not measurable .
so , how do you construct belief ?
var@@ una has but a thousand eyes .
you and i , only two .
or maybe you turn to the past .
maybe you look at the past and see .
has it done any good ?
and , sadly , we do n't know .
africans have already got a lot of aid .
these are the blue bars .
there 's only one africa .
so you have your million .
bed nets are very cheap .
so , what do you do ?
and a third question : education .
do you provide school lunch ?
so here is the thing .
so i start with immunization .
but maybe there is another problem as well .
so the blue dots are selected randomly .
so what do we find ?
well , beforehand , everything is the same .
we can know the answer to this question .
we can just run an experiment .
and now we can see what happens .
so , how about the purchasing ?
how about the long term ?
so what 's the best ?
consider for example transporting goods .
and here are the most surprising results .
and yet it does n't happen .
there 's no silver bullet .
so we should get started now .
it 's not going to be easy .
it 's a very slow process .
now , many of you will object .
you could call it te@@ distan .
how do we distribute ourselves around the world ?
let 's start with the world of 1945 .
over 50 new countries were born .
then came the end of the cold war .
and they share a lengthy land border .
why do they call it that ?
china is n't conquering mongolia .
so let 's apply this principle to siberia .
it starts with the global hubs .
is it really a border on the map ?
no . it 's the pipelines .
i do n't believe we should .
a great deal of them .
geopolitics is a very un@@ sentimental discipline .
i was the freak of the family .
i tagged along with my neighbors .
i read sar@@ tre and socrates .
what issues deeply concern you ?
well , she was shocked .
who should you invite to lunch ?
i 'll meet you there . "
and then i did it .
we know babies suffer from jealousy .
and what does jealousy like ?
freud would write about this later .
the novel is very good on this point .
for a year . a year .
this is something from a novel .
take tom ripley , her most famous character .
that 's one way to go .
we live in jealous times .
we 're proud of you . "
could it be so simple though ?
we could align ourselves with it .
but i like contingency plans .
we are in excellent company .
that 's 38 stories tall .
my wife and i adore our children .
that 's my son , oliver .
it became a writing project .
redwoods grow very slowly in their tops .
this is a flying buttress .
it 's absolutely heartbreaking to see .
what can the redwoods tell us about ourselves ?
so that 's johnny depp , of course .
and that 's johnny depp 's shoulder .
that did n't happen to me .
i do that hour@@ ly .
i learned a lesson from it .
and second of all , it requires imagination .
we wish we 'd gotten more of it .
we all know the short answer .
this is an unbelievably primitive emotional response .
we 're not trying to solve the problem .
we just want it to vanish .
what was i thinking ? "
we do n't understand that part .
this is obviously an incredibly painful experience .
we are all in this together .
so let me reassure you about something .
we 've got a climate crisis .
consumers do n't really like these light bulbs .
but the pay-@@ off is really enormous .
in fact , policy is par@@ amount .
their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology .
i guess that 's better living through bugs .
less than one day of exxon 's revenues .
not enough to stabilize the climate .
really think outside the box .
so we have to raise some money .
and here 's the opportunity .
now , the offenders , they also benefit .
that program started last month .
so what 's caused this excitement ?
why is this so different for people ?
the second piece it brings is ri@@ gor .
the last element is partnership .
so where does this leave us ?
and you observe a really strange effect .
we 're trying to prevent an impact .
is there a single equation for intelligence ?
does it predict human-@@ level intelligence ?
does it predict artificial intelligence ?
here are some examples of entropica in action .
there was massive flooding in indonesia .
and what about the web ?
i know we can do better .
globalization is getting more complex .
and this change is getting more rapid .
the future will be more unpredictable .
but there is an under@@ belly .
there are two achilles ' heels of globalization .
so what will this do ?
it will create huge opportunities in technology .
fantastic potential for regenerative medicine .
this would imply a massive leap in migration .
it 's going to require innovation .
it is vital that we do so .
i am a proud princeton dropout .
so , that 's unfortunate .
i like it quite a lot .
they own half a billion people .
it 's called the appointment dynamic .
and this is simply an appointment dynamic .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's a little scary .
and this is used in games as well .
and it 's very powerful .
it can be used in interesting ways .
this is used in conventional games as well .
so we have to use this one carefully .
this next decade is the decade of games .
this is an image of the planet earth .
can i reconstruct social networks of the past ?
vertically , you have the time .
how do we do that ?
i can digitize all these .
i can extract information from these .
so , it might not be enough .
and these are administrative documents .
" how much will it cost ? "
how can we represent that form of uncertainty ?
maybe there are several maps .
it 's really a question of scale .
at first , the results were predictable .
note that word " cooperate . "
these are necessary but insufficient questions .
these records were human resource forms .
that 's a powerful historical force .
but some verbs are irregular .
what 's the origin of this ?
i have occasional meetings with scientists .
who decides what reality is ?
how do we reconfigure it ?
" what does it matter ? "
the difference between thinking and doing .
it 's made out of ice .
it 's quite simple and fundamental .
and why would we want to do that ?
is there a sense of consequences ?
how do we create public space ?
mice are a very good representation .
that does n't do a lot of good .
this is one of the more ambitious ones .
you understand a solar chimney .
they said things like this .
there 's a good person .
these are just your average urban pigeon .
recorded voice : tick , tick , tick .
do you know what slows it down ?
that is , share your lunch .
this is what it looks like .
so there 's another function on here .
so updates from a beaver .
and why do i say that ?
they launched many , many successful attacks .
they were able to dis@@ able the brakes .
it 's more of a two-way radio .
it was mostly law enforcement and criminal .
that one 's pretty easy to fix .
what does this all mean ?
i 'll follow the rats . "
the construction began in 18@@ 37 .
it lasted about five years .
this is a tunnel underneath riverside park .
walking in this tunnel is very peaceful .
this is the same tunnel .
the first tunnels date back to 60 b.c.
this is the tower of saint jacques .
and then , can we replicate those actions ?
we 're starting to build resilience ourselves .
how can we give them some more experience ?
so we did some really simple things .
this is a movement for everyone .
we 're croche@@ ting a coral reef .
so i said yes to this proposition .
but she went into crochet over@@ drive .
cast it in bronze . "
the first one she did was knitting .
so what is this impossible hyperbolic structure ?
and they have different properties .
that 's our definition of a parallel line .
now mathematicians have answered that question .
there is , there 's a third alternative .
here is this diagram in croche@@ tness .
and the lines look curved .
and it 's a straight line .
we have these technologies . we use them .
crisis . death . disaster .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
jeopardy 's not an easy game .
it 's about the nuance of human language .
let me give you an example .
he 's the dude on the left .
so let 's project this analogy going forward .
we think about energy scarcity .
and there 's good news here .
now we talk about water wars .
" a pale blue dot . "
and we 've seen this in cellphones .
i call it the rising billion .
so the white lines here are population .
what about contributions we ca n't even predict ?
it 's a game called foldit .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
we have the passion of the diy innovator .
we have the capital of the techno-@@ philanthropist .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
let me show you how it works .
all of this happens in seconds .
they were gone in an instant .
and so this is not a video .
let me close with another short story .
let me leave you with a final thought .
so how does it work ?
and here are some of the ethical principles .
and the idea is that everything is defined .
and they were very closely associated .
and this network of relations is ever-@@ evolving .
so we call it a relational universe .
they 're thinking about the same things .
so this is the leading killer of women .
so it 's a woman 's disease now .
i 'm going to tell you why .
and then physicians have gone to bat .
we 've done the research .
we have effective therapies now .
women are living longer than ever .
and she wanted to study the tal@@ mud .
she had to imperson@@ ate a man .
she had to look like a man .
and they 're just passed .
and it funds a lot of my research .
it funds research all over the place .
it told us about hormone replacement therapy .
and our colleagues in washington , d.c.
hollywood heart attack . ugh@@ hhh .
that 's a man heart attack .
cellul@@ ite here , cellul@@ ite here .
now what are the implications of that ?
we selected this for the research .
and that is micro@@ vascular ob@@ struction .
these are our life-saving treatments .
and those little red boxes are deaths .
why are there women and men ?
because women bring new life into the world .
that 's all stem cells .
these are female and male stem cells .
okay , so here 's where we started .
we are bending the curve .
we 're bending the curve .
we 've worked on this for 15 years .
so we 're 35 years behind .
and in fact , it probably wo n't .
but we can not stop now .
too many lives are at stake .
so what do we need to do ?
to what extent are these people right ?
each country 's a bubble .
and the color now is the majority religion .
so we were careful with that .
so low income here , high income there .
japan here was regarded as an exception .
otherwise it was only christian countries .
we get that from the census data .
it has happened across the world .
but there 's no major difference .
there is a difference with income .
these countries have six children per woman .
congo will go from 60 to 120 .
just look what they have done .
it 's a tremendous improvement .
you need to have children to survive .
look at bangladesh and qatar .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
well i do as i always do .
very interesting . lots to read .
now look again at this .
we have reached peak child .
and the world population will stop growing .
well i will show you here .
they are quite useful for educational purposes .
each card box is one billion people .
this is me : 60-@@ plus .
we are here on top .
then the old will die .
this is fly-@@ by , marin@@ er iv .
it was taken in 1965 .
but let me start with a viking photograph .
and yes , the red planet is red .
we know a lot about mars .
very , very interesting planet .
this is 2,000 miles across .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- this is olympus mons .
this is bigger than the state of arizona .
we call this cru@@ stal magnetism .
is there water on mars ?
today mars is very very dry .
this is from spirit and opportunity .
this is ice water on mars .
that record exists on mars .
here is viking i , viking ii .
this is opportunity . this is spirit .
but look in the southern hemisphere .
there 's a model of ares here .
how do we transport an airplane to mars ?
in two words , very carefully .
how do we get it to mars ?
main engine start , and li@@ f@@ toff .
it enters the atmosphere of mars .
a parachute opens up to slow it down .
how do we know we can do it ?
we do our tests at 100,000 feet .
this is a half-@@ scale model .
this is a high-@@ altitude helium balloon .
i have a scale model here .
what ever happened to the small hadron collider ?
where is the small hadron collider ?
and they have absolutely amazing education systems .
they 're places like this .
and the education they got was pitiful .
it 's the mobile phone .
this is a private school .
those girls have never touched google .
they know nothing about wikipedia .
you can go to places like this .
i was literally pushed to school .
that is n't really going to attract him .
you need to pull him .
that 's too long if you 're poor .
these things , they teach through .
well , you create your own teachers .
pune has 5,000 building sites .
so i met this character , steven .
he 's a complete revolutionary .
you should turn it into mcdonald 's .
the mcdonald 's model scales .
the chinese restaurant model spreads .
there are two basic types of innovation .
we need more re@@ invention .
it 's an amazing thing .
but it will also lay waste to imagination .
what was this place called minto ?
and he was followed by her little sister .
these festivals are radically open .
they can transform cities and communities .
it should imagine a user .
that 's what he said .
it 's where we all belong . "
all of us ? designers ?
the song is just a given .
it 's how you cover it that matters .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- look at that !
intent changes the picture completely .
it conve@@ ys author@@ ship .
it suggests that someone is driving .
someone making the experience their own .
it 's a completely different domain .
we 're supposed to act with intent .
we 're supposed to do things by design .
intent is a marker for civilization .
in fact , maybe that 's the problem .
and so , little ajax was born .
he came out of nowhere .
we 're five now . five .
man , i love that thing .
what was going on then ?
human life needed a reason .
reality itself needed a designer .
that wo n't do at all .
i wish i could show you that contraption .
he would have loved those ! oh yeah .
and i pose this question .
you 'll never walk again . "
show everybody what you intend . "
daddy , this one 's for you .
how could we help you ? "
and every morning i hop on it .
and i put my challenge on 95 kg .
and we built an ipad application .
it was an evening dive .
this fish actually has high beams .
this is another one of my favorite fish .
it 's got a built-in flashlight .
this is an unbelievable light show .
it 's a magical place .
it 's clearly un@@ disturbed by us .
i promise , you 'll love it .
but nobody was really worried about this .
it would really boost the economy .
that 's how much power this computer uses .
how is the brain able to do this ?
that process is called a synapse .
it makes the brain inherently robust .
and then it also extracts movement .
yes , so that 's the idea .
oh , the wrath of photoshop .
i can see the rocks are over here .
we were a little bit ratt@@ led .
this is a serv@@ al cat .
and they only came for the ivory .
now let 's go over to india .
and he did it in a beautiful way .
we also want to look for solutions .
jim started in the battlefield .
but then paul got in the water .
so , she is pretty significant in size .
these are the displacement maps here .
here is the specular component ani@@ mating .
you can see all the wrinkles happening there .
and there is the underlying wire@@ frame mesh .
and that is emily herself .
and i ca n't complain about this .
i was going to miss my game shows .
and so i sold out way too young .
but that 's what i was doing .
i was not going to say no .
i had taken some artificial intelligence classes .
and at first , it was very low .
and i saw this line coming for me .
and i realized , this is it .
and so watson does not travel .
and it has n't been the last .
i 'm not an economist myself .
the things we know are still important .
there 's just too much .
do i take this job or that one ?
and you 'll make a less informed decision .
that 's often the advantage of time .
things always go terribly wrong .
and we can all make that choice .
i 've met a lot of them .
ladies and gentlemen , the choice is yours .
it 's not better public transportation .
so example number one : the internet itself .
they had none of that .
it 's more like a mo@@ sh pit .
no one pays you to do this .
but it did n't stop there .
now just think about that .
something is up in pakistan . "
example number two : wikipedia .
ji@@ mbo 's idea was for nu@@ pedia .
i 'm not taking sides .
hugely viral video . extremely popular .
totally mor@@ tifying to him .
you could see arguments on both sides .
it was an act of kindness .
is that an animal carcass behind her ? "
now why are people using it ?
it 's a brilliant idea .
the truth of the matter is otherwise .
we have access to it all .
what is the imagery of god ?
thank you , and god bless you .
i embody the central paradox .
we were exploring different aspects of ourselves .
and then we un@@ plugged .
people want to customize their lives .
so that 's the bottom line .
and we clean them up with technology .
it seemed to be looking in her eyes .
it seemed to be following the conversation .
and many people found this amazing .
that robot put on a great show .
it does n't face death .
it does n't know life . "
we are not so much in control .
it 's shaping a new way of being .
we 're smitten with technology .
but it 's time to talk .
i see some first steps .
do the same thing at work .
it 's like calling in the cavalry .
what do i mean by that ?
that 's what speech is like .
now we can write the way we talk .
it 's a very natural sense .
we linguists call things like that pragmatic particles .
another example is " slash . "
it 's used to change the scene .
you can go even further back .
that 'd be the second thing .
well , i work at the seti institute .
hello , come in , earth .
there we go . all right .
so here are pictures of myself .
now , frank did n't hear anything .
we still have n't heard anything .
we still have n't heard anything .
this is the allen telescope array electronics today .
they 're not building transmitters .
it would change his day , all right ?
that 's interesting to cosmologists .
you 've heard about it .
now , that 's not true anymore .
they get interested in something .
many rooms are not so good .
i am forced to ask myself a question .
the children could n't hear their teachers .
julian treasure : what a difference .
that is not good for you .
and that 's free out of that conference .
where are the office sound planners ?
where are the interior sound designers ?
we 're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors .
it 's a strange place inside a nanotube .
new ways of making electric transportation .
vaccines that are broad spectrum .
vaccines that we can manufacture quickly .
cocktails , more poly@@ valent vaccines .
markets are a very strong force .
how could you keep the law ?
customer : uh , let 's see .
our special is tracking cookie .
server : coming right up , sir .
your food will be served shortly .
that started my love for technology .
ideas can spark a movement .
ideas are opportunities and innovation .
thank you , and peace and blessings .
but i have a problem with that .
and this is what i said .
a verbal response would not be appropriate .
who is god in all this ? "
and i am among them .
is god a cold , un@@ feeling spectator ?
maybe god does n't do things at all .
what if god is in things ?
the loving soul of the universe .
what if god is in things ?
in the process of evolution .
in change and development and growth .
how could one practice such a faith ?
in awareness of the inner conversation .
where do you get your ideas ?
what other things take a really long time ?
some talking to the guests , some information .
we brought it on air in november 2009 .
we wanted to do something different .
the bergen railway was a recorded program .
would more people show up ?
what would it look like ?
it belongs to a guy called erik hansen .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- how did we do this ?
and with some very creative solutions .
he 's doing fine . everything went well .
some watched a little bit more .
some of you have seen the flag .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it 's a blind computer .
it had a speech synthesizer .
i slowed it down for you .
can we play that one ?
do you love being read to ?
is n't that a great book ?
i want that to happen .
i want to thank her too .
bless you . thank you very much .
it was the world 's first popular computer .
the plate corresponds to a coordinate system .
the idea is actually relatively simple .
and the altitude corresponds to the plate system .
and you can see the different components .
that 's the movable part of the sky .
they are just incredibly expensive .
and then i measure its altitude .
deneb is there . i can tell .
astrolabes have an incredible history .
they are over 2,000 years old .
so , what does the astrolabe inspire ?
it 's just an incredible device .
every dot is a person .
and eventually , you satur@@ ate the population .
exactly what we predicted happened .
here we are on october the 19th .
they are surrounded by immunized people .
and the answer is no .
just text us your temperature . "
we all know that it 's bill .
this is from some guy named ted .
ok , about a - two dozen .
the first one is harm / care .
the third foundation is in-group / loyalty .
but look at the other three lines .
here 's the data for 1,100 canadi@@ ans .
the truth of social entropy .
it shoots up and it keeps going up .
the grand canyon is really simple .
it 's not that complicated .
think about yin and yang .
you find the same thing in buddhism .
it seems quite v@@ ex@@ ing .
well , what about our brain then ?
and all of you are primates .
it is just a large primate brain .
so we did the math .
how did we get here , then ?
in two words , we cook .
it was a beautiful day .
we got to our camp@@ site .
i needed to go deeper .
then there 's the danger .
that 's really bad for the worker .
it must always be in motion .
and then there 's the stigma .
they wear a uniform in many cities .
you know when to expect them .
they are almost a form of reas@@ surance .
we 're going to be okay . "
we are going to be okay .
it 's a remarkable statistic .
take a moment to say thank you .
keep it quiet please . settle down .
and you do it automatically and non-@@ consciously .
what determines any decision you make ?
their focus is always about anticipated consequences .
and moderate on present-@@ hedonism .
you can see it in daily life .
we know our societies have to radically change .
and here 's the problem .
some of the ideas are strange .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i cut stories .
so my process is very straightforward .
but i was also a rebel .
i moved for two years in taiwan .
so artist books have a lot of definitions .
they come in a lot of different shapes .
they can be with words or without words .
i love oddities of languages .
it would make a very uplifting world .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- other ones are historical .
i call them freudian cities .
" re@@ ef@@ city . "
" a web of time . "
one story leads to another .
the result is " hells and heavens . "
other people make the opposite trip .
so you can take it off the wall .
they are more our social identities .
why do i call it a book ?
you take them for a walk .
and it 's still growing .
i also planted the bibli@@ o@@ tree .
but you have a bonus with this bench .
so each building has its own personality .
so that was a very captive audience .
and i wanted to give them an escape .
so i can call it techno-@@ crafted .
they have a lot of scenarios .
i do n't know the stories .
the answer is box@@ ers .
sb : what is it ?
here it 's slightly logged .
we have tokyo coming in in japanese .
there 's a lot of activity in china .
this is what one second looks like .
sb : yes ! somebody got it .
i 'll explain it in a second .
this is one of our engineers .
so this is what he built .
so it 's a fun little project .
larry , you can explain this one .
larry page : thank you , sergey .
do n't really pay attention to them .
how many of you use the desk@@ bar ?
this is actually our " cult picture . "
i just wanted to show quickly .
you want it to be consistent .
it would be artificial intelligence .
maybe , sergey , you can highlight this .
and that 's unlike many of our competitors .
i could n't offer them any direct help .
i was n't a citizen of that country .
they have nothing to compare it to .
it was more like a restaurant .
this is a family portrait .
my interpreter told me their stories .
wrong . they were all enslaved .
this young child is eight years old .
in the cold , windy night .
i want to introduce you to kofi .
i want to shine a light on slavery .
and of course , they were right .
it arises in the skin .
and i then moved back to edinburgh .
so they 're really an ideal model .
so these are kind of sun@@ lamps .
now , we 're still collecting data .
i 'm not sure exactly how much .
this is separate from vitamin d.
that is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle .
so vent@@ ura is in southern california .
so what do we think ?
we think it 's very important .
and this is about shifting baseline .
he was actually collecting fish .
this was the sail@@ fin grouper .
and i thought i could blend in .
this was my first sunburn .
they were maturing at five centimeters .
they had been pushed genetically .
they were still kind of happy .
this is a dead turtle .
it was not drowned yet .
but it 's not documented .
you can have a succession of changes .
you always lose rare animals .
some of them are very easy .
but it 's something completely wrong .
this is a very fast movement .
some of them are much more sophisticated .
but they are also able to sleep .
they communicate with other plants .
this is a serious business .
this is not a metaphor .
we have almost 14 million roots .
they work in the same way .
and why are they so similar ?
they work in the same way .
and another possibility is a technological possibility .
well , thank you for your attention .
but no adults liked the idea .
my dream would never come true .
but that 's so unfair .
so i was determined to find another calling .
nobody around to teach me ? fine .
books banned in china , of course .
the bible is interesting , but strange .
comparative reading actually is nothing new .
so may books be always with you .
this piece is called the studio .
lb : this one is about 9/11 memories .
ken@@ ny s@@ char@@ f 's graffiti .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- this is venice , italy .
this is the ancient city of pompeii .
this one is called instant noodles .
these pho@@ sph@@ ors can even cause cancer .
but it was exactly the opposite in egypt .
so , are you ready for the lecture ?
that 's it ; that 's the lecture .
take the example of flutes .
suppose we 're distributing flutes .
who should get the best ones ?
who should get the best flute ?
you can just call it out .
peter : the greatest benefit to all .
ms : the greatest benefit to all .
well , it 's a good reason .
they said , " no .
suppose you were on the supreme court .
how would you answer the objection ?
ms : walking all those holes ?
warren : i am not a golfer .
is walking the course essential to the game ?
and what do you suppose they all said ?
what do you suppose they said ?
seven to two , they ruled .
here 's how he put it .
that 's really what marriage is about .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you very much .
that 's what i would love to do .
there 's the one that cuts itself .
let 's hear it . shake . louder .
audience : fold . js : really loud .
audience : shake . fold .
js : okay . wet hands .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- tri@@ -@@ fold . fold ...
-lrb- applause -rrb- audience : shake .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- audience : shake . fold .
audience : shake . fold .
it 's way too big a towel .
let me tell you a secret .
and you get half a towel .
audience : shake . fold .
and next year , toilet paper .
we try to avoid blowing ourselves up .
this one i thought i 'd show you .
it branches on more the experimental side .
there 's the improvisa@@ tional side of jazz .
you can skip the dust part .
video : okay , we have parachute aligned .
bc : we enter the martian atmosphere .
it probably gets about room temperature .
and that would be bad .
it 's this immensely exciting and challenging problem .
one of them is called enceladus .
but there was something bizarre about it .
we saw geysers coming out .
ra@@ jiv suffers from a mental illness .
i see some nodding heads there .
so i should talk about art .
well the range is quite a bit .
this is nell rem@@ mel .
and this is 22 feet long .
and i love to dig a hole .
and this piece is " frost . "
he draws sticks real good . "
sylvia 's interested in art training .
she 's a very serious swiss artist .
and this one had to get broken up .
that 's my mom and dad .
we just have that natural way of seeing .
and he plays with this idea .
there 's another pile of leaves .
and he pairs these up with paintings .
but it 's actually a painting .
so that 's what she did .
and that 's the symbol of their culture .
next is may@@ nard si@@ pes .
next is gin@@ ger che@@ shire .
the next , this is by sam sandy .
next is by ver@@ a soko@@ lo@@ va .
thank you . thank you .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you . thanks .
my story starts way before i was born .
so this really , really fascinated me .
-lrb- applause -rrb- i live in south central .
it 's 150 feet by 10 feet .
and the garden , it was beautiful .
we had a victory on our hands .
that 's 20 central parks .
see , i 'm an artist .
that 's why it 's on the street .
and when we do this , who knows ?
now do n't get me wrong .
get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
and let that be your weapon of choice .
and it 's a number of projects .
a very , very beautiful object .
unfortunately , it 's not the answer .
it 's only the beginning of the problem .
how does it affect the design of buildings ?
in 2001 , this building received an award .
this building was wired for change .
well , obviously the building still happened .
so it would be totally renewable .
you can measure it again .
now what form do they take ?
and that 's a concer@@ ted platform .
they are not lux@@ u@@ ries .
i looked into her face .
they touched me at that time .
they have touched me throughout my 68 years .
and there are various facets .
it is there within every human being .
the very word terror is global .
the very feeling of terror is global .
he sees something in the path .
the wound is just filled with maggots .
what good is more going to do ?
and the alligator has some very sophisticated senses .
but it has all this complex behavior already .
now , in evolution , what happened ?
you 're constantly making predictions about your environment .
here 's three visions of an object .
so what will brain theory look like ?
it 's also memory of sequences .
that was n't being asked .
the cancer was too advanced .
i brought some for her parents .
i mean , how hard can it be ?
some of you may have heard of this .
but what if we have it backwards ?
i 'm betting my career on this .
-lrb- applause -rrb- -lrb- music -rrb- good afternoon .
now a laser is different .
i have a ph.@@ d in molecular biology .
now surprisingly , it seems to work .
they do it by changing their shape .
and this brings me to my modest proposal .
one certainly ca n't argue with those numbers .
we live in a modern , global world .
terrorists have actually adapted to it .
the brand has an achilles ' heel .
that 's where their consumers come from .
how are we going to do these attacks ?
we 've got to show our values .
this is my favorite part of my speech .
we 're all victims of terrorism .
the son 's dead . the father lives .
but mistakes of the past are inevitable .
they 're not just going to be smart .
a civil action was brought from 1998 .
the advantages of dialogue are obvious .
the private sector has a role .
it 's changed my life .
we will overtake china by 20@@ 34 .
i think you 've already heard the figures .
but sometimes it just sat there .
i went to high school in calcutta .
she ca n't understand the dialogue .
and this is happening more and more .
india does n't have a military mission there .
every afghan family wanted to watch it .
they had to suspend functions at 8:30 .
so the empire can strike back .
all the others have been all those three .
it was essentially india being itself .
i almost lost it this week .
and one of my favorite robots is leonardo .
leo , this is cookie monster .
can you find cookie monster ?
leo , cookie monster is very bad .
he 's very bad , leo .
cookie monster is very , very bad .
he 's a scary monster .
he wants to get your cookies .
but with the robot , you can .
the first was just the screen .
we looked at overall engagement .
we looked at their desire to cooperate .
this is a robot , au@@ tom .
it could make eye contact with you .
the quality of advice was identical .
people would name the robots .
they would dress the robots .
but we can push this idea further .
and now it 's got number power .
but i want to do more than that .
she 's in a very supportive environment .
her mother 's doing everything she can .
this is her 10 years later .
if we could play this video please .
do you remember writing that chapter ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it comes in handy .
cl : and so she 's phenomenal .
now the problems begin first with pitch perception .
now if we could just play this .
that 's kind of hypnotic .
-lrb- trumpet -rrb- the trumpet .
-lrb- violin -rrb- that 's a violin .
and yes , there is hope .
this is ... does somebody know ?
because his grave was ex@@ hu@@ med .
the brains remain hardwired for music .
and here 's a video of joseph .
and it was absolutely wonderful .
you do n't actually have to hear it .
so this is a start .
and i 'm absolutely enthr@@ alled by biology .
i love to do synthetic biology .
i love things that are alive .
i love manipulating the infrastructure of biology .
and this seems quite a profound question .
so here 's some inorganic life .
this is an inorganic tube .
now , that 's a bit boring .
is life that improbable ? "
and this is really the question .
so think , this is a serious question .
and forgive the complicated diagram .
synthetic biologists are manipulating it .
but what else is life characterized by ?
and we went through a variety of worlds .
we then got to the last ancestor .
so we have some kind of primordial soup .
but we need to make some containers .
molecules are competing for stuff .
they want their shape to persist .
and that is the key .
so imagine we make a little cell .
we should take our inspiration from biology .
evolution can not be cut apart .
you 're sitting on chairs .
we really struggle to do this .
ca : that would be a big story .
around the world , people love .
but love is n't always a happy experience .
i am thinking of your love for me .
i am torn by your love for me .
i am told you will go from here .
my body is numb with grief .
it 's way below your cognitive thinking process .
it 's below your emotions .
somebody is camping in your head .
it is a homeo@@ static imbalance .
it 's deeply embedded in the brain .
-lrb- applause -rrb- we invent .
we 've got a different solution .
so we made this thing .
it ven@@ ds out little individual vi@@ als .
two hundred million people a year .
we could spend hours going over this .
that 's really , really , really short .
this is our thousand-@@ core supercomputer .
okay , we heard about bed nets earlier .
you spend a certain amount per bed net .
you can give drug administration .
ultimately , it gives you this .
this is malaria spreading across madagascar .
we 're going to the dry season now .
we also try to study our fo@@ e .
what can we do to the mosquito ?
you really want to protect them .
now , it actually gets better than this .
they 're the only ones that are dangerous .
we have the device over here .
the energy 's a little bit high here .
here 's another one . bang .
the wing motor is very resilient .
it poses a very fascinating puzzle for us .
i 'll bet nelson has a cellphone .
in particular check out asia .
this next chart looks at more recent data .
now the chinese example shows us several points .
one is : preserve choices for people .
two : operate on the right scale .
with that charter , people will move there .
the city can be built .
and we can scale this model .
those are captured in the charter .
you start from uninhabited territory .
why is this not like colonialism ?
they want to get out .
build - run a special administrative zone .
let us have a hong kong nearby .
it 's a rule for changing rules .
their kids can get an education .
let me conclude with this picture .
think about what you might pick .
they 're not being really strategic at all .
but they lose , right ?
so they 're smart , but poor .
there 's almost no difference .
this is a bargaining game .
that 's kind of a mistake together .
your intuition might tell you that too .
this is from the first two seconds .
here 's the case where the disagreements occur .
there 's a lot more arrows .
maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you .
let 's see how they can do it .
they 're going to press left or right .
one chimp is called a matcher .
the mismatcher wants to mismatch .
and the rewards are apple cube rewards .
now they get three apple cubes .
so here are some things we learned today .
but that system has tons of problems .
wealth piles up in the wrong places .
but here 's what i learned .
but let me explain what i 'm thinking .
social security is fairly easy to fix .
raise medical health care contributions ?
that 's a more partisan area .
around a quarter say that they are republicans .
i go by the data . "
and the data is very clear .
those groups are very , very small .
then you can see radical partisan change .
and nothing happened at all .
we do more than that .
there was so much to learn .
but it was a terrific job .
it was a strange sensation .
and the orthopedic center was closed .
the cars disappeared as well .
" i work , " he said .
i wondered , what work ?
maybe the machinery is broken .
and i spoke with a gatekeeper .
give him some money . "
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
and they were not alone .
i said , " no .
it 's not a priority . "
we have other things to do . "
so we started doing some repairs .
maybe some of them are here now .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so we started .
and mahmoud was coming every day .
but finally , the great day arrived .
suddenly , they started fighting .
i met mahmoud one year later .
i asked about his son .
i said , " okay . "
it was the easiest way .
and then he sat down .
we need to increase the production . "
but with najmuddin , we can not discuss .
i ca n't believe it . "
the production was up 20 percent .
and then i asked for veri@@ fication .
so of course , i understood .
it 's good for everybody .
but also for the newcomers .
and you see the faces .
and then the surprise turns into hope .
scraps of men do not exist .
terrible najmuddin , is that one .
this is my big wish .
we transport the wheelchairs everywhere .
well now you should see me .
and you should see me during the match .
i shout like a true italian .
and what did it start ?
is it that i write very well ?
so what kind of a contributor was i ?
they must not remain anonymous .
how will it be a knowledge society ?
it must be the same .
-lrb- murm@@ uring -rrb- pardon ?
i 'm so sorry to say that .
we should be doing something about it .
and we do not ask this question .
you must have taken tea in the morning .
no machines have been developed .
this is what honey bee network is about .
and it all begins with curiosity .
it all begins with curiosity .
and this is what he got painted .
look at what she has done .
please understand the problem of poor people .
it looks like a beautiful photograph .
it 's a ta@@ wa .
it 's a hot plate made of clay .
now , what is the beauty in it ?
he has designed this plate with a handle .
look at what he is doing .
i had to meet my love .
my desperation made me an innovator .
even love needs help from technology .
now , they call me the local spiderman .
re@@ my@@ a jose has developed ...
this innovation is from the slums of rio .
but this innovation emerged in brazil .
that is what kan@@ ak das has done .
assa@@ m , kan@@ ak go@@ go@@ i .
she said , " change your profession . "
but it 's not that straightforward .
and yet , we began .
that 's the economic invisibility of nature .
it completely passes below the radar screen .
how bad can things get ?
the green represents the percentage .
that 's not that hard .
so now look at the different lens .
sorry , this is a global story .
can we stop this , and how ?
it 's about energy emissions .
more of that in a minute .
so we actually have some movement forward .
well i 'm afraid not .
so that 's almost an eighth of society .
what 's going on in the u.s. government ?
so that was the 20th century .
it 's bigger than the anti-@@ apartheid movement .
why the limits to the movement ?
the recovery 's going to take some time .
he was successful with women .
these are the places he was drawn to .
he moved with the headlines .
he negotiates with the ser@@ bs .
so then you have to make the decision .
but it was too late for sergio .
but he lun@@ ged in the opposite direction .
that 's not a bad size home .
and that 's what we 're doing .
this is what 's planned for 2015 .
and we can question these values .
is it " still " permissible ?
we 're fishing at the low end .
but really it means excellence .
it tries to affect people .
we organize the existence of people .
i do n't think so .
as michel fou@@ ca@@ ult puts it .
and with that , i thank you .
the world wide web ? not so sure .
well then , why is it doing this ?
it 's a little brain worm .
no , it 's worse than that .
now , this is a profound biological effect .
now here am i talking about his idea .
but it 's everybody 's idea now .
but it is a problem .
what 's a word made of ?
there are different species of memes .
not just the priests . everybody .
it 's part of their plan .
they are wiping out languages .
they are wiping out traditions and practices .
they 're like a mild cold .
and we should be very alert to this .
you will never annihil@@ ate the germs .
it is why i look to art .
it 's why i ask questions of art .
it is why i make exhibitions .
that was , in fact , economic .
but it 's not the only one .
so , the match was ended in between .
and then an enormous accident took place .
but there was another big date .
india , the world champions .
six weeks , city versus city .
the other was indian cricket .
but was india ready for it ?
so , it was a different india .
there is cricket and the movies .
but take a look at this .
could you have imagined that day would come ?
that 's not bad , is it ?
but we did it . you know why ?
and that felt good , you know ?
so how do we ask this question ?
now , how far does this analogy go ?
they fl@@ unk out of caltech .
that was a really good time .
lots of lives are being saved by those .
narrator : they took pictures .
we 'll see what happens .
so you feel that in your cubicle .
but it was intended to be quite quiet .
you can see : there 's the plant .
this product , it has two cameras .
he 's made 30,000 new jobs .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- can you read it ?
it is all about passion .
people like all of you in this room .
i looked like a refrigerator .
so here 's a tale of passion .
she 's pregnant and a widow .
they have no education and no freedom .
jenny has a brave and passionate heart .
millions of women live like this today .
they are the poorest of the poor .
i want to make this world good .
paper maps are becoming obsolete .
" okay , what about the fbi ? "
so , there we were .
we 're almost blindly reli@@ ant on it .
some call it " the invisible utility . "
so let me show you how this works .
at this point , the game is over .
so is this really possible ?
well , the short answer is yes .
the gps dot will fundamentally reorder your life .
we 're pale , gray creatures .
and everyone was doing the same .
so we started re@@ touching photos .
this was the very first .
she also had dupli@@ cates .
and this happens every two weeks .
pal@@ din is a 6@@ 2@@ -year-old monk .
and he spent 33 years in prison .
i interview and do portraits .
and this is a little girl .
this is at 17,000 feet .
and he still is holding this line .
this is m@@ eng@@ at@@ ou@@ e .
we now have 15 sites .
we just had a workshop in guatemala .
mosquitos . i hate them .
but that 's fascinating , right ?
and therefore , we set up various experiments .
why did we set up these experiments ?
and we found some remarkable differences .
and you know what ? it worked .
my second story is remarkable as well .
ooh , that was very quick .
" where were you october 5th ? "
we read about six months of my calendar .
i was like , " great . "
i work at a university .
i was like , " no . "
so they 're looking at me really odd .
this is with the fbi .
and there was a sincere concern there .
then i 'd make websites .
so i actually designed this back in 2003 .
and i 'll help you out .
and there 's a veri@@ fication taking place .
sometimes there 's a lot of information .
and then sometimes you get this .
so there 's multiple databases .
so sometimes the databases get so specific .
at 11@@ :@@ 39 a.m. was this one .
every few moments i shoot the image .
well you have to take control over it .
but if 300 million people in the u.s.
and we 're getting to that .
why are you posting these photos ? "
because no one 's really watching .
because it 's about surveillance .
i 'm watching who 's watching me .
and i came up with these .
so these are some of my sample logs .
executive office of the president .
so it 's just become another day .
and everything 's automated at the other end .
so it holds onto the very last point .
and then she actually built it .
it 's built almost entirely from bamboo .
this room we left open .
it 's actually a wild grass .
it 's a promise to the kids .
it is growing all around us .
it 's strong . it 's elegant .
it 's earthqua@@ ke-@@ resistant .
a restaurant with an open-air kitchen .
bor@@ ax is a natural salt .
it turns bamboo into a viable building material .
we have had to invent our own rules .
so that 's the blueprint of the house .
why are doors so often rectangular ?
anybody can play in the game .
but the stage is crowded .
why does it matter ? who cares ?
the answer is it matters quite a lot .
let me give you an example from history .
notice both halves of that explanation .
no , i think that 's wrong .
power is chao@@ tically distributed .
wars persist . power persists .
i remember my first fire .
well , i was next .
the captain wa@@ ved me over .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i swear .
and you know what i 've learned ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- mark bezos : thank you .
so rovs are n't new .
they 've been around for decades .
did you find the gold ?
now i want to step back a bit .
most parents would find that great .
that 's a statement about vision .
we actually know how to test that statement .
and it 's better in two different ways .
right ? so this is the first example .
-lsb- " blue " -rsb- db : yellow .
was it yellow initially or blue ?
audience : yellow@@ .@@ db : good .
that 's a multimedia-@@ task@@ er .
that 's the chocolate side of the equation .
e : hi , sweetheart .
e : -lsb- squawks -rsb- sw : yeah .
e : ow , ow , ow .
sw : do your head now .
einstein , can you also sing ?
e : la , la .
e : what 's the matter ?
you like to drink water .
what do you say to a good-looking man ?
e : hey , baby .
e : ye@@ e ha@@ w .
e : woo , woo , woo .
sw : and the penguin ?
e : quack , quack , quack .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- what about a wolf ?
e : oo@@ oo@@ ow@@ ww .
sw : and a pig ?
sw : and the rooster ?
e : cock@@ -@@ a-@@ dood@@ le-@@ doo !
sw : and how about those cats ?
e : gr@@ rr@@ r@@ r .
sw : yeah . you are a superstar .
why do we want to protect your home ?
e : i 'm special .
e : i love you .
the first is really the notion of people .
we thought of people as a liability .
we talk of people as human capital .
the next thing is technology .
and really there are four things here .
it 's certainly not like china .
it is reflected in the political statements .
every province had its own market for agriculture .
the ideas that we argue about .
this policy is causing gridlock .
the third thing is our higher education .
indian higher education is completely regulated .
now why does this matter to you ?
and that makes a huge difference .
the front page became our signature .
my approach was very egoti@@ stic .
not even magazines : posters .
soon it started to bring results .
and that is really amazing .
then we adjust the content accordingly .
so what is the lesson behind it ?
it can even change you .
and who 's responsible ? designers .
and everybody can do it .
but that is no way to survive .
that hope kept me alive .
i did n't even go to middle school .
you have to choose to believe in hope .
you have to make it yourself .
hope brought me to america .
i did not come here by myself .
north koreans are fighting hard to survive .
this is my message to you .
joseph kim : in korean ?
and i - oh , gosh .
jm : thank you all .
the school i went to was pretty boring .
and that was the finishing post right there .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so this was extremely embarrassing .
the graphics were just horrible .
and that 's what it looked like .
last year was the biggest year .
43 percent of gamers are female .
the average age of gamers ?
all video games are violent .
but he got great terms on it .
that 's what the show looks like .
so we 're going to start that video .
you need to be really an incredible artist .
so i 'd like to play this video .
at some point something clicked .
we are interacting with our entertainment .
the people who create these games are smart .
something has happened to my brain .
the sensory cues are very similar .
for my virtual worlds are perfect .
i know that i am losing my grip .
the most important one being fun .
he 's out of time .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so , my closing thought .
that was a great day for my mother .
and grandma was even more excited .
look , the homes are full of machines .
i ca n't even name them all .
they wash like this : by hand .
and they want the washing machine .
and no one raised their hand .
this group uses three , one each .
and they will double their energy use .
so what needs to be done ?
they must change behavior in some way .
this is what we hope may happen .
it 's a real challenge in the future .
and what 's the magic with them ?
and she also got books for herself .
and so what did we find ?
but the romans developed sal@@ ting .
so it 's not all hopeless .
that 's a question for the future .
we found life in the extremes .
so we 've done pretty well .
we actually do n't know .
we 've lost a lot of paradise .
and there are a lot of other pressures .
and as the oceans go so shall we .
that 's the good news .
i told them they 're nuts .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i can not do that .
you could see he was missing an arm .
he was leaning on his other arm .
they 're not finished giving yet . "
so , we went back .
he 's got no legs .
he had one good eye .
" you 'll get them . "
this kid was from stat@@ en island .
he does n't really want a lot .
i was asked to stop at texas .
" you need to come . "
some further along than others .
" who is entitled to what ?
who is entitled to how much ?
who is going to pay for it ? "
i do n't know the answers .
there are other questions that are tough .
" should we be there ?
it is an easy answer .
wil@@ bu@@ r and or@@ ville .
that 's why they migrate to cities .
most of them were about resources .
we 're all in this together .
it 's just the beginning , unfortunately .
it 's more than enough reason for pessimism .
it is something to be greatly optimistic about .
it 's not ancient history .
and we had to start all over again .
and i believe the answer is yes .
i am collaborating with charlie brown .
he 's dedicated his life to sustainable design .
i mean , i feel useless .
that does n't interest me .
i call that the cynical design .
what civilization creates this society ?
what animal species creates this civilization ?
the big challenge in front of us .
voice off@@ stage : four point five .
can you imagine ? it 's very symbolic .
and this territory is fantastic .
i can explain you . i shall try .
nobody 's obliged to be a genius .
it 's very , very , very important .
this line of evolution is clearly positive .
it 's made of light and shadow .
there is different type of barbaria .
that 's why we must adapt .
because it 's not the right time .
we have just to finish the story .
that is very , very important .
no , you must really understand that .
the universe is really big .
but we would also like to understand it .
that kind of makes sense to us .
the air in this room is very smooth .
in particular , things were a lot denser .
there is something that made it that way .
we would like to know what .
you 've heard of entropy .
we learned that it 's accelerating .
the universe is not only expanding .
finally , empty space has a temperature .
well what is the implication of that ?
it 's very , very unlikely .
but there will also be large fluctuations .
so this scenario makes predictions .
and feynman also understood this .
i just showed you this picture .
that empty space lasts essentially forever .
so here 's two questions for you .
why are n't we in empty space ?
more homework assignment for you .
that 's my favorite scenario .
they 're not even enjoying the show .
it really helps you appreciate the good times .
so just imagine that for a moment .
both are viable ; both take off .
we 'll come back to these people later .
intersex comes in a lot of different forms .
they 're in the back of our body .
and so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were moving towards a natur@@ alistic concept .
it turns out to be really difficult .
do we really want to go there ?
i 'm not sure where we go .
we do n't have that kind of situation .
so we call this anatom@@ age table .
then it 's going to show inside .
you can see some internal organs .
so we call this the sli@@ cer mode .
this shows a lot of internal structures .
i 'm going to do some surgery here .
it does n't have to be always dissection .
maybe i can add quickly this way .
we can see ten@@ dons and muscles .
it 's a female now .
and it received quite a bit of attention .
it 's a very solitary creature .
and those white markings are not natural markings .
i went down there in the winter time .
and that 's because the urchins eat kelp .
so i think the message is clear .
all of my work begins very simple .
these cli@@ p@@ boards are filled with numbers .
that begins my translation process .
and together , these variables construct a score .
scientists and engineers change the world .
i feel a little uncomfortable .
that 's still true today .
that 's an unnatural act for a rocket .
the third stage has a camera .
we call it rocke@@ t@@ cam .
this is a hummingbird drone .
it can hover and rotate .
it weighs less than one aa battery .
it does not eat nectar .
many prototypes crashed - many .
matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot .
it was made in tobacco plants .
but it too had humble beginnings .
jason har@@ ley did that for me .
he was with our transportation team .
he was encouraging , but firm .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you . thank you .
rd : it might be a little warm .
we 've got to fly it first .
ca : but not necessarily just a camera ?
ca : it 's amazing .
that 's what we do .
now our responsibility is to push that edge .
ca : how do you answer them ?
all of us are makers .
guy : where did you guys get those ?
lady : will you glide with us ?
that 's the experience of a clever ride .
and of course , we have fashion .
so , are you a maker ?
and again , think about it .
they 're a little bit radical .
and i found this old video .
it did n't just exist .
and i think that 's tremendously important .
he liked to take things apart .
and he began building robots .
let me say that again : playing .
now here 's something - a 3d printer .
this is ma@@ ker@@ bot .
and they do interesting things .
boy : what do you do all day ?
boy : do n't you get bored ?
marcus : because i do what i like ?
marcus : a modern day poet .
boy : yeah , you could say that .
marcus : so what do you talk about ?
boy : what 's that supposed to mean ?
boy : reality , man .
boy : my fuckin ' reality .
marcus : tell me about your reality .
without food - i was sick .
the injection made us not to have mind .
ezra : i do n't remember .
the men@@ de sons of bastards .
-lrb- shouting -rrb- who is she ?
why you giving these to me ?
my story is a little bit complicated .
big mouth . short legs .
he 's not taking care of his troops .
open your eyes , ezra .
this must be the mine .
well done , well done .
ezra : my name is ezra gelehun .
e : we were fighting for our freedom .
e : you are richer than us .
but we pay for school .
why ? because you want our diamond .
you are not on trial .
e : so you are a liar .
that 's really my thinking .
my mom left nairobi , kenya .
i went to high school .
2006 was a great year .
2007 was a great year .
very sadly , he took his own life .
and it was a really heavy time .
it started getting bigger and bigger and bigger .
so let 's talk about those three as .
they are attitude , awareness and authenticity .
the second " a " is awareness .
he 's number 76 in the picture .
that 's what he said .
so those are the three a 's .
you can sleep in clean sheets .
and that 's the sad part .
it 's a high-@@ strength polymer .
it was ending up in landfills .
some of you may recognize this .
the converse is also true .
it 's a challenge to our ingenuity .
so this is how this scheme would look .
this is a hotel in bolivia .
and this is an important point .
it 's the hollowing out of small towns .
the economy is mostly agricultural .
there is n't even a walmart .
we now call this place home .
this is the most complex .
it 's a vocational training path .
and this is what it looks like .
and then this is anthony .
i learned so much about myself .
i have to report it . "
sure . it 's the computer .
but technology alone is not enough .
so here 's gdp per person in america .
and that 's just the united states .
now let 's look to the future .
welcome to the economics of abundance .
consider one project : ibm 's watson .
what can we do to create shared prosperity ?
that is our grand challenge .
but i really like my tea sweet . "
it is essential for success .
you will surely find the perfect match .
there are some dilemmas you see .
what do any parent do ?
they had all suffered the same tragedy .
but there was a big difference .
we found that it did .
and i ca n't decide .
" okay , great . "
" what does it look like ? "
what 's different about them ? "
okay , we got that .
it basically organizes itself . "
you really reduce congestion quite substantially .
but it was fun anyway .
the first day they all came back .
they 're not even aware of this themselves .
who changed their opinion , and why ?
and this is what it is .
this is a small modular reactor .
this is between 50 and 100 megawatts .
but that 's a ton of power .
this region right here is the reactor .
their burn@@ -up is much higher .
that is the rocket designer 's dream .
that 's a ton of power .
that could power a martian community .
that could power a rocket there .
i also put in here the stress response .
we really have two command posts .
people have also wanted to deconstruct .
and we see here the smile .
our pleasures are really ancient .
here is a three-@@ wee@@ k-@@ old baby .
we are social beings from the beginning .
there is a profound need to belong .
but it 's not irrelevant .
so clearly there is some effect .
but the effect is relatively small .
so we have here , this couple .
i end with a few quotes .
in fact , i went to nashville .
inside your heart a voice is calling .
and i 've played thousands of shows .
and i see the power of music .
and this little girl comes up to me .
she started singing her song .
we have really no idea .
and the answer is : all of them .
those are all basically the same thing .
that 's what technology really wants .
our humanity is actually defined by technology .
that 's what we 're talking about .
that 's what technology wants .
that recursive nature is the infinite game .
but the information was closer to me .
it meant something to them .
and they will step up .
again , " thrilled " to learn .
and they had certain criteria to do it .
go create . go figure it out .
let 's see what we can do .
ask them really interesting questions .
the first is the critical price .
linux is another good example .
now we 've switched to critical mass .
and you 've seen the numbers .
and why is our democracy not working ?
they find me up on the top terrace .
let me tell you a story .
sunday evening , brussels , april 2010 .
but time we did n't get .
picture yourselves around the table in brussels .
let 's deliberate a little bit longer . "
we were led by our fears .
let 's throw democracy at the problem .
you are going to take the photos .
you 're going to send them to me .
and we keep sending more every day .
boom ! this is what happened .
shar@@ meen is actually here .
and i want to thank her today .
and he 's here also today .
there are tons of school projects .
but maybe we should change the question .
can art change people 's lives ?
let 's turn the world inside out together .
see any common themes ? principles ?
what experiments would you run ?
the leg is acting as a foot .
take a look at what that is !
this one disgu@@ ises itself as floating algae .
and watch again , right there - successful .
this is really , really difficult .
but look at this animal do it !
these are all from different insects .
so it 's pretty tough to do .
it certainly helps it to hold on .
now we have something better here .
very strange . how do they stick ?
but it makes an incredible band-aid .
here you are , pulling off the band-aid .
otherwise these secrets will be lost forever .
i became an inventor by accident .
has n't changed that much .
i have a couple of units .
but they want to use it - seriously .
lin@@ ear@@ ity means higher quality sound .
i have a bunch of other inventions .
we 're using very short wavelengths .
turn it on ; turn it off .
that 's a fluorescent tube refined . "
yeah , there you go .
there 's something terrible happening . "
and i started to cry .
you 're much too young to help .
but just unpack your suitcase . "
when do i give in ?
what will i stand up for ?
but she told the students to sit down .
and no one got killed .
but we have to practice .
so what about our fear ?
i have a little mantra .
the fear is the child .
how can this be made better ?
how can the child feel stronger ?
they are human beings just like us .
so that 's the third one , anger .
it 's bottom-up or grassroots power .
they know best what to do .
you do n't believe me ?
and this has n't just happened .
and it 's been translated into 26 languages .
it 's flown around the world .
because finally human beings are getting it .
now i do n't just believe in non-violence .
i do n't have to believe in it .
she is no more a free individual .
but we came across a new phenomenon .
it was called tal@@ ib@@ ani@@ zation .
hundreds of schools were lost .
it 's really the most scary thing .
the world turned into a big black hole .
you stood for the right cause .
but my daughter never complained .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- he was talking about morality .
uses very , very little power .
very , very high resolution .
we start . this is day one .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- day two .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- day five and day six .
satan . satan . satan .
then portuguese to pig latin .
for example , in cheese sandwiches .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- is it the virgin mary ?
or is it men@@ a tro@@ tt ?
and all the trees have turned brown .
but the kids were the best part .
and she 's now in her 80s .
no hope of describing that .
by the way , africa is very large .
it 's still going on .
it just does n't exist scientifically .
they want to be the next einstein .
and we got lots of appli@@ can@@ ts .
and that 's really exciting .
no dron@@ ing on at the chalkboard .
and aims has done extremely well .
and where they are is indicated over here .
so here you can see behind this list .
and i 'll just show you one .
i will be attending aims .
professor : tendai is working very independently .
so i 'm happy she 's here .
stephen hawking : that is nice .
here 's somebody you 've seen already .
this is ezra . she 's from darfur .
and here are the ones we 've selected .
it wo n't be easy .
so you can open this one .
this is one of my favorites .
it also runs on the iphone .
you can pinch into any page .
what is the business here ?
this is a pic@@ or@@ na@@ virus .
but really , it 's pretty robust .
so how do we deal with this ?
well , it 's pretty simple .
day zero : nothing happening .
so , that 's great .
so , we built out the chip .
and this is what this looks like .
they did a ct scan .
she could no longer breathe for herself .
what to do next ? do n't know .
these guys really do have this virus .
but now it 's a door .
that 's where we 're at .
this is a collaboration between myself and don .
this one is more than 400 years old .
that 's a tough space to stand in .
you know where this story goes .
and i 'm going to admit to hubris .
so it ca n't be true . "
all the rest were historical .
they do it to make a profit .
and i want to be very clear .
i 'm talking about real slavery .
well , it builds up with these factors .
these young boys are in nepal .
it 's a horrible situation .
and it can be done .
we do not buy people out of slavery .
in fact , it 's peanuts .
it 's just not going to happen .
this is what liberation really looks like .
we 'd been working there about a month .
i was frightened . we were frightened .
did you notice this section is foreplay ?
and so they still were n't getting it .
and they said , calcium carbonate .
and they did n't know that .
why do n't they just keep on going ?
three questions , for me , are key .
how does life make things ?
that 's a ger@@ anium pollen .
in other words : structure .
this is san@@ dia national labs .
imagine being able to make perfect lenses .
solar transformations : the most exciting one .
see that up-@@ close picture ?
here are two organisms that pull water .
separation technologies are going to be extremely important .
healing : this is a good one .
i 'm not going to get to 12 .
good luck having a conversation with them .
ok , so that 's the healing one .
and that 's the growing fertility .
our farming has done the opposite .
that 's the twel@@ f@@ th one .
ca : janine , thank you so much .
something always seems to stop us .
i remember march the 15th , 2000 .
you think of carbon as black .
what if we combined it with this ?
we talked about generating and using .
and what they built was e@@ box .
these also require tremendous amounts of energy .
we 're simply not going to do that .
we can do better than this .
we should do better than this .
you do n't have enough time .
the team is proud of our four attempts .
it 's an expedition of some 30 people .
and we 've been on a journey .
and now we 're there .
it 's difficult to swim in .
that 's the everyday mach@@ inations .
the epic journey is going to be over .
that little tracker that was on the computer ?
to be is to do .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- bonnie , where are you ?
and yeah , i stand before you now .
thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
we 're the new technologists .
how much power do we have ?
i can look at your financial records .
i can look at your clicking patterns .
what 's the right thing to do ?
but it brings me back .
so we can make money ?
or should we leave him alone ?
what 's a moral operating system ?
we all know right and wrong , right ?
maybe we just follow our gut .
so let 's get a moral framework .
we 're numbers people , living by numbers .
plato , that 's right .
you were sleeping during that class .
he wanted to know what is just .
in math , we know the objective facts .
favorite number . i love that number .
that 's a stunning vision .
that 's as ambitious as we are .
he wants to solve ethics .
that 's a utilitarian moral framework .
but here 's the way it works .
it does something intrinsic to the act .
it 's just a matter of the consequences .
so let 's cut to the chase .
how should we be making our decisions ?
there 's not a formula .
there 's not a simple answer .
in fact , let 's start right now .
or now we have a few more choices .
are you ready ? go .
now the next step - try this .
it 's based on norse legend .
we 're the ones writing this opera .
we determine how this will all end .
this is what happens every year .
this is what keeps its promise .
there is lots of showing off .
there 's lots of grand openings .
and we looked at it together .
it does n't do it with a chemical .
co2 as a building block .
nature does something much more elegant .
and it 's in every cell .
it 's strong and resilient .
it 's called as@@ k@@ nat@@ ure@@ .org.
thomas dolby : david byrne .
we 're not the only ones .
now , why is that a problem ?
and that kept him going .
how would you look at me ?
this is the damage it causes .
and i was just moved .
i was actually crying during his presentation .
so , what is to be done ?
we heard about that yesterday .
we had some of them this morning .
it only has five contributors .
where are the rest of the swahili speakers ?
you know , just jump .
we 've manually entered all the data there .
where do we go from here ?
i believe in the power of ideas .
i believe in the power of sharing knowledge .
it 's not that easy , you know ?
i was paying her school fees .
an example . this man changed my life .
and this is just an illustration .
you can meet other individuals here .
we just need a push .
this adds together four different waves .
take your finger and draw this line .
the earth is neither flat nor round .
let me show you one more .
i like working with my hands .
jc : and does it ever change ?
for example , molecular structure .
because it is hard to make symmetry .
artists too love to play around with symmetry .
this is a palace celebrating symmetry .
but i wanted to try and enrich him .
and so what is symmetry ?
the alhambra somehow asks all of these questions .
let 's take the twisted six-@@ pointed starfish .
it 's got no reflective symmetry .
it seems mad to talk about nothing .
so , this object has six symmetries .
so both of these objects have six symmetries .
so here is a little question for you .
it still ends up at half a turn .
i think this is an amazing development .
and all the tiles match up again .
here is another example in the alhambra .
and it turns out they almost did .
but these are things that we can see .
20 digits or less , sit down .
how many digits are there in your number ?
so now i need to name this object .
so why did they go ?
why choose this as our goal ?
we choose to go to the moon .
we choose to go to the moon .
you hear it all the time .
they 've expanded and enriched our lives .
it was just three days away .
well , it 's certainly not this one .
sex tips are not glamorous .
there 's the glamour of physics .
so what do we mean by glamour ?
glamour was a literal magic spell .
but still , glamour is an illusion .
glamour is a magic spell .
and this is hedy lamarr .
and it involves a great deal of technique .
glamour does n't have to be people .
architectural photography is extremely glamorous .
it 's a very glamorous portrait .
it makes things look effortless .
this is underneath jeff 's desk .
the perfect ge@@ taway in your perfect car .
we want this golden world .
this is from soviet union . attractive .
you know , we 're marching toward utopia .
it was a very aesthetic ideology .
so glamour can be dangerous .
i 'm not against glamour .
and here 's hedy lamarr .
and that has a fascination .
it changed the way our history developed .
so let 's make a little test .
turn and face your neighbors .
please , also on the balcony .
smile . smile . open the mouths .
sounds like fast food , does n't it .
we talk about ourselves as omni@@ vores .
so cooking is a very important technology .
and you need some design to be successful .
we walked out of africa two times .
we populated all the eco@@ logies .
it keeps also your brain working .
you can continue to innovate and invent .
how did it actually interfere ?
what kind of criteria did it use ?
so satisfaction was a very important part .
this is what we are using . "
it penetr@@ ates the muc@@ o@@ sa .
it has 20 different neuron types .
it 's this brain which makes this reflex .
we have transferred enough energy . "
this is an in vitro experiment .
we only meet them once .
he built the capital over there .
the building was finished in 1983 .
nk : you 're proud of it ?
man : louis kahn , yes !
man : very pleased to welcome you back .
no , he never saw this .
in that way it is so relevant .
nk : it cost him his life .
but he was also human .
the project is part art and part science .
it 's a primitive coni@@ fer .
the tree can easily recover .
a lot goes to the u.k. , germany .
you probably start the day with a shower .
and can you send me a bullet ? "
it 's really a sort of magical moment .
power was focused at the very top .
representative government began to form .
but time is a factor .
now we live in a global economy .
notice that certain individuals are highlighted .
these are the hubs of social networks .
i think the secret will be transparency .
since then , what 's happened ?
we need to get away from instrumental arguments .
why should we get away from those arguments ?
the point about democracy is intrinsic .
every chimpanzee has his or her own personality .
something 's happening for conservation .
there is a great deal of poverty .
and everywhere there were these terrible problems .
the earth is poisoning our foods .
we 've talked about the soil erosion .
it 's africa that already is affected .
we have compromised their future .
it 's one of my hob@@ by@@ horses .
do we care about their future ?
or my grandchild , or whatever it is .
all of these technologies we can use .
and an example is the tacare program .
it 's a real pleasure to be here .
i talked about spaghetti sauce .
and the man 's name is carl norden .
carl norden was born in 1880 .
and he 's a swiss engineer , carl .
it 's a complicated physics problem .
it weighs about 50 lbs .
it 's called the norden mark 15 bombsight .
and he makes this complicated thing .
it was like man@@ na from heaven .
and what was god 's will ?
and what did the norden bombsight do ?
well it allowed you to do that .
it 's never allowed to be photographed .
the norden bombsight is the holy grail .
secondly , it breaks down a lot .
there are clouds , right .
10 percent . 10 percent .
oh no , they were brilliantly accurate .
or take the battle in afghanistan .
now what is the accuracy of those drones ?
he was a committed christian .
it would have broken his heart .
it 's really become sacred to us .
i 'm always the one taking the picture .
now your task is to move objects around .
so we sometimes laugh about teenagers .
a computer magician can write this thing .
this is why i went to afghanistan .
i was alone on foot .
those are basic human values .
but the mongo@@ ls get there first .
noor is arabic for light .
i do n't belong there .
why three ? a couple of reasons .
al-@@ bat@@ ina is the hidden .
my wife is a saudi from yemeni roots .
like i care , right ?
so if we can get the lights ...
dana : there 's too much darkness .
i ca n't forget a@@ untie .
you are no@@ ora the light .
now , tell me which way to go .
jabbar : aa@@ a@@ ahhh !
miklos : stay away from me .
jabbar : we 're here to help you .
-lsb- " the 99 " -rsb- thank you .
it was an orthodox jewish community .
i have work to do . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- true story .
-lrb- applause -rrb- hi everyone .
it 's a little quirky and silly .
you can tickle the rug .
you can make the baby poop .
you can do all those fun things .
i have to tell you about my childhood .
it was a very beautiful time .
imagine history being taught differently .
but they 're playing geopolitics .
had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
did they eat fish and chips ?
did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ?
george frankly preferred numbers to people .
they saw it as thinking .
so how do organizations think ?
eighty-@@ five percent is a really big number .
they ca n't think together .
maybe he 'd look stupid .
they think of him as a leader .
openness is n't the end .
kb : i love that shot .
but technology alone is n't enough .
and that sequence was especially difficult .
it depends solely on the bat .
necessity is the mother of evolution .
-lrb- applause -rrb- kb : what a tongue .
there are so many wonderful places .
and i was di@@ stra@@ ught .
the book was published in 2009 .
but they mean two different things .
we do n't work from offices .
the most important thing is passion .
you can give somebody an idea .
let me tell you a secret .
you have to create a new profession .
we have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
government ? forget about it !
dear@@ born , michigan . henry ford .
this person has never been born .
there is what oprah tells us .
and does purpose play into it ?
your chances are very low .
it reminds me of my college days .
and it builds up exponentially .
these are years that we could get .
it 's called can@@ non@@ au .
that 's called the grandmother effect .
they have what we want .
and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease .
it was invented by confucius .
their average age is 102 .
adventists are conservative metho@@ di@@ sts .
this is a heterogene@@ ous community .
they take this sanctuary in time very serious .
and then marge de@@ ton .
i 've been on 19 hardcore expeditions .
what are the things that they all do ?
they do n't have any conveniences .
the okinaw@@ ans have this ancestor vener@@ ation .
there 's no longevity diet .
i did n't hear the boundaries .
this is slave labor to my own project .
but there is another world .
and i do n't mean automated machines .
we need a few simple ingredients .
and then you need smar@@ tly designed interactions .
and then we embed elastic .
this is the polio virus .
you shake it hard and it breaks apart .
so remember , i said 4@@ d .
and space is a great example of that .
and it 's an african story .
the industry is 15 years old .
and i was born in zambia .
and he had nine days to make it .
i would like to show you six minutes .
and you shoot in seven days .
he needs proper medical attention .
it 's the blockbuster comedy .
you 'll crack your ribs .
it 's all about the foreign movies .
but we can do something too .
man : just arrest yourself , sergeant .
you see the person live .
man : see you . bye .
cover this . it 's your own .
the masking tape will hold it .
i 'm trying to protect my face too .
so many themes in this story .
and this has unleashed tremendous energy .
no stories around the campfire .
so this is what i really think .
i would like you to hear their voices .
and i really hope that this will happen .
there is scientific data on this .
ca : 2,000 films a year ?
and we know that there are more .
so imagine 45 films per week .
they are bought in video shops .
they can be rented for pennies .
ca : on what format ?
they started with v@@ hs .
they started in ' 92 , ' 94 .
ca : franco , thank you so much .
and the ideas are very disparate .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's pretty ambiguous .
i gave myself the problem .
and that 's a little found object .
i imagine what can be said with them .
i 'm always imagining myself in different situations .
i 'm imagining myself as a machine .
i would love to be bathed in oil .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it 's definitely happy .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and that was that tool .
so , that 's a finished gear .
but i had a lot of fun .
it means nothing at all .
the object itself just means nothing .
they do not have good enough infrastructure .
and this is what we saw .
just a quick idea of the measurements .
what could they learn to do ?
in short , what all of us do .
so , how do they do that ?
so what does the eight-year-old do ?
can technology alter the acquisition of values ?
so here are my four sentences then .
remoteness affects the quality of education .
i 'll just be doing it .
yeah ? it 's absolutely there .
so we 're starting to build a phrase .
i 'm not asking them to copy exactly .
some work very much in specific detail .
can you place that down into the floor ?
whoom , just go back to the beginning .
throw it into the audience again .
so the dancers have been working on them .
they want to be part of it .
i work in global poverty .
will i not make enough money ?
your job is only to be human .
we do n't talk about the sacrifice .
and they 're incredible guys .
and they 're doing it .
but there 's only one mosque .
and every day we have a choice .
-lrb- applause -rrb- companies are losing control .
they can design for it . but how ?
companies can even give control to hackers .
force them to help others .
i always wanted to be outside the box .
do you even know how a trillion looks ?
rous discovered this in 19@@ 11 .
all you need is a single oncogene .
now , let 's take a normal example .
i work on breast cancer .
so , here is a lovely human breast .
they are completely different from each other .
so , what does this tell you ?
so , what do we do now ?
i made a radical hypothesis .
this is what we got .
we can revert the malignant phenotype .
so it 's like form and function .
why do n't we start there ?
that 's all i 'd ever known .
he 's just a rather intimidating figure .
why do n't you just tell them ?
it was really , really hot .
and he just sat there like this .
he kept me on the right track .
am : no , a year .
it 's my first international meet .
i wanted to find out times .
am : oh , sure .
ss : yes , there you go .
i need a little bit off . "
no , these legs are great .
ss : that 's aimee mul@@ lins .
one day they 'll get here .
i can feel your noise .
some of them committed suicide .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- your call . your call .
everyone 's somewhere in the middle .
maybe no one 's really crazy .
everyone is just a little bit mad .
you can call it suburban sprawl .
and it 's a tremendous problem for us .
so how is that being accomplished here ?
this is the other side of the building .
you know , that 's not good enough .
we have to do good buildings .
they 're not the same thing .
because - notice the porch here .
these are not good enough for americans .
this is a real school !
it is going to change absolutely everything .
and america 's not prepared .
be prepared to be good neighbors .
consumers are different than citizens .
we also are going to need political innovation .
and what does that look like ?
we love back@@ -of-@@ envelope calculations .
we 'll use biofuels . problem solved .
that 's the european average for new cars .
that 's true of european biofuels .
what do we do with these numbers ?
and that 's the answer .
that 's 15 years of progress .
so here come some renewables .
next , let 's look at solar power .
we just need to understand the numbers .
and that 's a serious option .
that 's the average european car .
next , there 's the heating lever .
so here 's a typical crappy british house .
here 's a graph i made .
we need a plan that adds up .
but the victorians actually did it .
what they did was amazing .
it 's still with us today .
it 's called the bureaucratic administrative machine .
they must be identical to each other .
the victorians were great engineers .
well , the cler@@ ks are the computers .
they do need to be able to read .
the children came running in .
here 's a short glimpse from those years .
we look at it every single day . "
thirty percent is a fail .
so she did that for two more months .
the scores jumped to 50 percent .
-lrb- children speaking -rrb- neurons ... communication .
so what are jobs going to be like ?
but look at it this way .
what an achievement that is .
encouragement seems to be the key .
there is evidence from neuroscience .
why did they create a system like that ?
but the age of empires is gone .
i got 200 in the first two weeks .
the granny cloud sits on the internet .
you ca n't catch me .
grandmother : well done ! very good .
here 's a sole in action .
sm : a decade ahead of her time .
but that 's not sexy enough .
so what 's my wish ?
help me build this school .
the rest of it 's from the cloud .
and just one last thing .
another one from k@@ archer .
and let me just show you that .
that was not a controlled descent .
nick rober@@ t@@ son has that story .
good robot , that 's good .
and it looks for things that move around .
and it looks right at that .
and so these weights change .
it sees her , pays attention to her .
you 're such a cute little robot .
voice : ... very good , kismet .
so we put this in the robot .
i want to show you my watch . "
robot : oh , cool .
this is another robot , co@@ g .
they want to take over from us .
it 's a rare condition .
i can see it in their eyes .
they want to ask me something .
here are three questions drawn from my work .
i 'm an extreme example of this .
one is a flash of white light .
and here is one of my paintings .
and nabokov was himself synesthetic .
another example : a little bit more mathematical .
easy when you know how .
some people say it 's happy .
and it actually means sad .
but is that really the case ?
and there 's a lot of it .
what is it made of ?
and why on earth could that be so ?
we express these things mathematically .
they require very similar mathematics .
here 's an example of this similarity .
it 's a very simple example .
there are lots of more sophisticated examples .
symmetry is very important in this discussion .
they are symmetries of the sphere .
steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity .
it 's the same theory of gravity .
it ste@@ ms from the character of gravity .
they are properties of the fundamental law .
they follow from the fundamental theory .
we have already an autonomous vehicle .
it was an absolutely amazing experience .
so how does it work ?
so we have three steps .
well there comes the first box .
now let 's see if mark avoids it .
mark ric@@ co@@ bono : yes .
you must be out of your mind . "
and i truly believe that this can happen .
how are we going to handle insurance ?
the building was a true bird-@@ killer .
it 's laying dead on its belly .
both are of the male sex .
i did n't have the framework .
and here 's the situation again .
and here are the ducks again .
you can pass it around .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- this is a moose .
this is in montana , 2008 .
this is the netherlands , 2011 .
these are cane to@@ ads in australia .
please note that this is necrophilia .
it 's remarkable : the position .
these are pigeons in rotterdam .
so what does this mean ?
and here you see a dead duck .
so there goes my theory of necrophilia .
that 's on june 5 every year .
-lrb- applause -rrb- oh , sorry .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
she 's an italian fashion designer .
she 's turning it inside out .
and sometimes these are fun , right ?
there 's lots of virtues of copying .
i love these gal@@ li@@ an@@ os .
jokes , no copyright protection .
this is a difficult , unstable binary .
it 's a digital file .
he 's smart , he 's smart .
this is mass general in boston .
so let me back up a little bit .
there 's no specificity there .
so they added two additional components .
the molecule passes through and gets excre@@ ted .
can you tell where the tumor is ?
but here it is . it 's fluorescent .
and i 'm peeling that muscle away .
so that takes more time .
anesthesi@@ ologists , surgeons are waiting around .
but i went ahead anyway .
so there 's that teamwork thing again .
you can see where they are .
when we put these two probes together ...
so here 's a tumor .
that white portion there is easy to see .
this was a bit of a breakthrough .
they said , " wow !
i have patients who would benefit from this .
it is not a sprint .
now why was i so grateful to ted ?
because i feel an urgency about this .
and we need to revive that spirit .
the same applies to educators .
now , why do i say that ?
it was a 10 by 10 cell .
nobody is controlling what you do .
the buildings here are multi-@@ story .
that 's also in istanbul , turkey .
they have more things going on in them .
it 's on very steep ground .
so , that 's a restaurant .
i say there are two things .
they can be community leaders .
the issue is not urban poverty .
here is my naive advertising man 's suggestion .
so i 'll ask you another question .
what on earth is wrong with place@@ bos ?
it was an absolute masterpiece .
ataturk was a lateral thinker .
all value is perceived value .
we invented the whole lot of them .
i 'll give you one example .
so they are introducing new diamond shreddies .
man : just try both of them .
take a square one there , first .
they were called de@@ programmers .
and i then became a de@@ programmer .
and about 20 years went by .
it was on jon@@ est@@ own .
i understand how this could happen .
" moon is one with god .
we 're beginning to look inside the brain .
she ended up underneath the car .
somehow i ended up at the hospital .
18 months later i woke up .
some things worked , some things did n't .
i had more than 50 surgeries .
i was wearing hospital scru@@ bs .
and they went through that process .
but the men had a better idea .
the redundancy was actually good for me .
so we 'll just keep moving on .
one was post-traumatic stress disorder .
so i was walking around it .
so i discovered some very interesting things .
and i 'm not comfortable with that .
so here 's a new definition for doodling .
and i think that is incredible .
and i will go you one further .
ghana felt safe to me as a child .
i was free , i was happy .
it was a di@@ mly lit shack .
now this was being broadcast live .
and it worked , or so i believed .
i was always playing the exotic african .
people were being beaten brutally .
the sounds of the voices were harmon@@ ious .
a democracy could be uph@@ eld peacefully .
now here 's an interesting comparison .
i mean , it was so incredibly close .
and guess what , it worked .
and yes , we africans can .
that was a tradition i wanted to follow .
this was once a park .
this is an msf hospital in cambodia .
this is a scene from new orleans .
-lrb- applause -rrb- hey guys .
what stops us from making them ?
because this is how reality is created .
we wo n't bring anything with us .
i did n't show him .
so let me show you a little demo .
a pencil is not just a pencil .
and the electricity runs through your body too .
the metal in the sink is conductive .
i ran these workshops everywhere .
see where it says " sister " ?
we did n't plan for that at all .
i did n't come from a military family .
i 'm not a military brat .
and i kept on getting lost .
that was the new reality .
this is even before i deployed .
" thank you for your service . "
it plays out in all of our memories .
it plays out in all of our emotions .
he loses his leg in iraq .
or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
does this sound familiar to you ?
there 's another reason as well .
it 's extraordinary to watch .
now watch , he has to down@@ shift .
and then he has to turn left .
look for the tree , and down .
so watch as john does this here .
and their actions are fantastic .
it could run a metabolism on it .
so , something is missing .
you add the droplet to the system .
we 're going to make two different kinds .
" great - got it . "
so the next day i go out .
melanie is the wife of albert .
albert is the shepherd in question .
can we roll the video ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- " this is crazy .
we ca n't do this . "
and albert 's like , " what ? "
he says , " ok . "
when does he get up ? "
he 's like , " a day . "
albert hands me the knife .
i go in , tail comes off .
" push it further . "
just bite ' em off . "
i went in and i took them .
and they are anagnorisis and peripeteia .
anagnorisis is the greek word for discovery .
that 's peripe@@ ty or peripeteia .
he 's making a great living .
and he 'd laugh at you .
he did n't follow his passion .
and i hear that story over and over .
now , he 's selling them to walmart .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- no , i mean really .
and he points out there .
it 's a civil war .
it 's a cold war , really .
you see him all the time .
that 's what tv does .
we 're plugged in ; we 're connected .
good grief , not to this crowd .
the infrastructure is a huge deal .
run the movie , please .
they pass information to each other .
now , our classrooms could use change .
the seats are in color .
everything else has changed around us .
we really have to completely reimagine it .
even the infrastructure has to change .
and we had no marketing budget .
7,@@ 200 is also a big number .
it 's a digital language .
" honey , come over for dinner . "
" did you hear me ? "
i text her , she responds .
it 's just been absolutely great .
but our kids are really different .
so here 's what we can do .
they can have discussions amongst themselves .
they can solve problems together .
we were also doing other pilots .
one idea is active learning .
you teach by asking questions .
they can hit the pause button .
they can re@@ wind the professor .
heck , they can even mute the professor .
your computer is grading all the exercises .
the next big idea is ga@@ mification .
let me tell you a story .
they had answered questions for 100 students .
how do you do that for 150,000 ?
had popped in with a different answer .
the aa@@ kash is 40 dollars .
we so rarely look at the sky .
open your eyes . look at that .
okay , a few of you .
so what is a glacier ?
so how do you map a cave ?
who studied some physics in university ?
okay , lots of you .
so , physics and marketing .
getting a little more technical now .
the act of observation changes it .
it 's the same in marketing .
well , you know the story .
the same is true of marketing .
but then you lose control of it .
this is what i found out .
arm amputation causes a huge disability .
i mean , the functional impairment is clear .
our hands are amazing instruments .
there 's also a huge emotional impact .
we talk with our hands .
we greet with our hands .
there are two general types .
you open it , these muscles contract .
there 's no other functions .
how do we control them ?
and your sensation 's the exact opposite .
those nerves can put out command signals .
so we developed a different approach .
his name is jesse sul@@ li@@ van .
and this is what it looks like .
his brain is thinking about his arm .
that 's why it 's intuitive .
so it was very exciting .
can you tell us how it worked ?
tk : so it was a little slow ?
you had to concentrate a whole lot .
then we fit her with a prosthesis .
and how did that work for you ?
tk : a little faster ?
tk : okay , this was my goal .
and it provides intuitive control .
so that was all very exciting .
but we want to do better .
i can wear it around .
it 's all the pattern recognition .
ak : i was able to get four .
i want you to watch closely .
but look at all the electrodes around it .
i 've got a real estate problem .
we want to build a better arm .
so those are just some of our goals .
and fortunately , it worked today .
these people are n't that smart .
so , what is the deal here ?
hers is more into boys .
girl 2 : uh , yeah .
but she gives my sister everything .
miko : i do n't think so .
rockett : really ? what other party ?
he 's invited all the best people .
oops , i turned the wrong way .
it turns out they 're really great .
just being out on the street was exhilarating .
you 're all part of the artwork too .
the woman paid him no heed .
and it 's not only about women .
there is a trend here .
have we stopped seeing injustice ?
no . it breaks through those .
for me it came very early .
so , what do they do ?
because there is no profit in it .
woman : all right , father .
all the germs from the water we take .
all the germs from the water we take .
our drinking water safe we make .
our drinking water safe we make .
well , here is one such way .
your parents were peaceful people .
your grandparents were peaceful people .
so much peace in one place ?
how could it be otherwise ?
-lrb- music -rrb- but , what if ...
goodbye , martin luther king .
hello civilization . hello , 21st century .
look what they 've done .
it needs to be the yeast . "
but the princess continued whistling .
but the king had an idea .
-lrb- whistling -rrb- some whistled badly .
but nobody could defeat the princess .
" uh-huh ... " she said .
every piece of the building works .
i 'd like to conclude by saying something ...
beauty in the most profound sense of fit .
he who seeks gratification shall be disappointed .
arrogance is incompatible with nature .
you know what they say ?
you 've read about it already .
that makes a good cartoon .
so we are bridging the digital divide .
well , you 've got mail .
this is your life , enjoy it .
they are shaping the way we consume .
they are shaping our very desires .
they wanted to stir up controversy .
this looks like a giant hamburger .
so you see the style is different .
so this is really journalism in cartoons .
you 'll hear more and more about it .
and i went to see the doz@@ o .
they are believed to have magical powers .
they can disappear and escape bullets .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- " another time . "
and what can a cartoonist do ?
so the idea was pretty simple .
show the positive power of cartoons .
so the idea was there .
so this was a great project .
he has to keep his job .
now , chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression .
have a look what she 's doing .
but play 's a shape@@ shif@@ ter .
and let me start with this .
we did n't see a single shark .
fan@@ ning island , 2,500 people .
you can see sharks in every single dive .
what have we learned from these places ?
but this is a consequence .
the size of these boxes is bigger .
well , there are several ways .
so the fishermen are catching more .
reserves are like savings accounts .
so how much of this do we have ?
and how can we reach that goal ?
en@@ ric sala : thank you .
ca : that 's very fascinating .
es : at least in the seas .
and on land , this can not work .
we think this is universal .
the last one 's a personal question .
es : it is a spiritual experience .
they behaved just like the children .
another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy .
because of its seductive capacity .
you 've got to have skepticism and humility .
at the moment our rights are incredibly weak .
so this is a nand gate .
so basically you have a chain of elements .
we 'll have spatial computing .
so it 's exciting potential for this .
and inflation has come down .
now this is a huge achievement .
because we are confronted with a challenge .
people do n't have voice .
the economies were not growing .
we were having negative per capita growth .
that 's engaging in the wrong debate .
how do we combine all this ?
the issue is not that .
is it being directed effectively ?
i want to tell you a little story .
we were on the biafran side .
we thought she was going to die .
my father was not there .
he was in the army .
my sister fell very ill with malaria .
and then my sister woke up .
i strapped her on my back .
what has happened in europe ?
and now i 'm maybe being harsh .
as a continent , here are our priorities .
but it can not do it alone .
do n't be shy of it .
they do n't shy away from infrastructure .
infrastructure , infrastructure , infrastructure and discipline .
am i out of time ?
she needs another 20 million .
there are many different kinds of mess .
but it is not so .
so let me show you a few objects .
well , it 's very interesting .
very few things are very smooth .
you must do it differently .
we see mountains in the distance .
now it 's very easy to do .
now a lung is something very strange .
you have formulas that long .
and you crank it several times .
well , they do mix .
the things on the ground are algae .
the eiffel tower has a fractal aspect .
i see ; it 's an island . "
i measured it , 1.@@ 33 .
again , again , again .
mathematical problem : how to prove it ?
it took my friends 20 years .
" well , acts of god .
that is the meat , the problem .
well , here are the curves for it .
this shape is of an extraordinary complication .
it 's so simple , so dry .
i mean this comes out .
i do n't want to explain these things .
this comes out . this comes out .
the color was added for two reasons .
so where did this come from ?
this is stephen hawking 's universe .
this is fairly amazing to me .
i 've been quite interested in both .
but you see a very clear trend .
you could buy 10 million in 2002 .
and this is a very widespread phenomena .
and this technology is also accelerating .
these things have already been done in animals .
where will we get the software ?
it turns out that we can understand it .
that was strictly a capital-@@ markets phenomena .
by 2010 computers will disappear .
machines can share their knowledge very quickly .
we are going to merge with our technology .
these are very powerful technologies .
she 's a bit of a hippie .
my father 's a little different .
and mad and crazy and fun .
i had to meet my prime minister .
i saw layers of security .
this is one i remember fon@@ dly .
except , i even started painting dancers .
and i saw my work come alive .
the collaborative effort was fabulous .
american education is so expensive .
my dad knows a bunch of rich guys .
that 's us in new york .
something happened along the line .
my mother fell very ill .
i was on a high .
my life was not exuberant .
i lost all my audiences .
of course , none of them liked it .
how can a family get dysfunctional ?
and ru@@ dra was born .
that 's my little son .
everything about my work has become more whimsical .
it talks about mental in@@ cest .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- these are just different cartoons .
so i said , okay .
and i drew it out for her .
that 's a sane response to war .
it was six miles long .
there was no running water .
there was no way to bathe .
they never even got out of their clothes .
they fought . the worked .
they slept in the same clothes .
combat they did learn to like .
that 's how bored they were .
usually , you 're not scared .
you get this weird tunnel vision .
it 's wired into us .
it 's hormon@@ ally supported .
it was machine gun fire .
just think about the math on that .
the boys are up there for a year .
i 'm still very good friends with him .
i had a dinner party one night .
he 's not a psychop@@ ath .
he does n't miss killing people .
i think what he missed is brotherhood .
now , brotherhood is different from friendship .
friendship happens in society , obviously .
it did n't bother him .
they thought he was dead .
the bullet had just knocked him out .
it glan@@ ced off the helmet .
this was n't invented recently .
they send him to iraq .
he does n't have that community anymore .
they send him to iraq .
and then everything went black .
where was i ? what was happening ?
i broke some bones in my feet .
" no . it 's too hard . "
i was at a crossroads .
it was the fight of my life .
i felt so incredibly grateful for my life .
in the spinal ward , that 's normal .
i realized sister sam was right .
and i wanted to give up .
is that a problem ? "
he went , " oh . "
and i said , " yeah . "
and sometimes i thought that too .
and then i got my instructor rating .
and mom and dad ? never been up .
thank you . -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
it 's also moving vertically .
the world needs an international forum .
and watch that beginning to happen .
but that 's no longer true .
now we have to call in others .
now we have to create the g20 .
oh yes ? why not ?
how many americans ? 11 .
they want to keep the sea lanes open .
but now we are intimately locked together .
now the enemy is inside the walls .
and this tells you something very important .
but now one final thing .
it is no longer the case .
collective security is not enough .
they shared a destiny with their enemies .
the great poem of john donne 's .
so here 's what you do .
and then one of two things will happen .
i was coming back to visit her .
the next time , after the 15th toss .
so what 's going on here ?
it takes longer , on average .
anything different about the two patterns ?
you ca n't do that with head-tail-tail .
there are two ways of thinking about this .
i 'll give you one of them .
then you toss the coin .
what 's the point i want to make ?
how long will those chunks be ? "
you know about the human genome project .
why do we care about that ?
that 's one big project .
we do n't know what causes them .
so a natural answer is 99 percent .
that 's what you might think .
so let me try and illustrate that .
each of them taken together is unlikely .
and secondly , it 's palp@@ ably false .
that 's the first problem .
now , that 's a logical error .
it 's exactly the same in this context .
the other explanation is that she was guilty .
we do n't know what it is .
we know the children died .
and they 're both implausible .
that 's what engineers do . "
so , this is an astounding table .
we can prevent most cancers .
why is it a disease of the aged ?
why is it hard to treat ?
and that 's about it .
it 's manifestations of a disease .
this is n't a genetic disease .
it 's what we call a system .
the goal is to control cancer .
we need to take a step back . "
most of that state is hidden .
it 's a system of systems .
it 's never been shown .
another 30 percent will respond .
we can start to see that system .
and the answer , obviously , is not .
and we learned something important there .
so , it 's a fundamental problem .
it 's taking a big picture .
we need a radically different approach .
and well , they 're very excited .
but i do n't mind .
really , it 's amazing .
there are so many celebrities running around here .
did you know that about her ?
yeah , she 's lovely .
it 's like a rainbow .
it 's true . it 's true .
thank you for all that you do .
so , happy continued success .
congratulations . ma@@ zel to@@ v .
-lrb- applause -rrb- hi . hi .
that 's very good . i love that .
i come from a multicultural family .
it 's a long story , believe me .
although , you know , it was wonderful .
and they 've inspired many characters as well .
for example , a friend of mine .
uh , well , thank you .
thank you . xi@@ e xi@@ e .
i am originally from jordan .
but i am very proud of my students .
so , back in the ancient times .
i want to hold your hand .
i want to hold your hand .
thank you for having me .
i just - thank you .
something really weird is going on here .
and they do n't tell us much .
it 's not moving like that .
one of two things is going to happen .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
and those are the neural structures .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
there are billions of them .
save those . kill off the rest .
they 're obscure , weird programs .
but they do the job .
so it 's feeding back on itself .
we 're right at that point of transition .
i see one guy there .
now what does this tell us ?
you 've known these people your entire life .
this is vani@@ shingly rare among mammals .
that indicates female cop@@ ul@@ atory vocali@@ zation .
that 's what the external testicles are .
i 'm sorry . it 's true .
now , this evidence goes way beyond anatomy .
it goes into anthropology as well .
women have hundreds of partners .
the biological father is a non@@ issue .
but that 's just an example .
and that 's changed irre@@ voca@@ bly .
so i wrote a letter .
they were well respected . they were known .
let 's see who they are . "
and you have to do that investigative work .
it 's no longer valid or real .
is it who we really are ?
the self was not constant .
that confirms its existence and its importance .
it has an extremely important function .
my hair was n't right .
my history was n't right .
i was a no@@ tice@@ able nobody .
and i was a really good dancer .
because we all stem from africa .
on the one hand , result .
my desire to disappear was still very powerful .
i take it to therapy .
simple awareness is where it begins .
how are we going to introduce her ? "
knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom .
i 'm trying to buy time .
get rid of your mind .
get out of it , get it out .
so that 's what i do .
so , how far does eternity go ?
so what did i do ?
so what is a story ?
we are the stories we tell ourselves .
we create stories to define our existence .
a film tells a story .
and i look for stories on each level .
find that which is not .
and so they helped the just one .
the gods sent the storm . "
so what was i doing ?
so can we have that second ?
-lrb- music -rrb- elizabeth : bess ?
bess : here , my lady .
elizabeth : tell me , is it true ?
bess : yes , my lady .
elizabeth : tra@@ it@@ or@@ ous .
you dare to keep secrets from me ?
my bit@@ ches wear my collars .
what am i doing with the architecture ?
the architecture is telling a story .
so how do i start all this ?
what 's the process of telling a story ?
and an idea started to develop .
so how does that become a story ?
you understand flyovers ? yeah ?
so the design has a story .
it is finite ; harmony is infinite .
it is the hot topic .
this is the great frontier .
but it has its limitations .
i can make them healthy . "
it is very useful in certain circumstances .
but it rarely happens in biology .
people have tried very hard to do this .
not going to be easy . "
so we started playing around with this .
so let me move to cancer .
so this is the great paradigm .
we know that that works .
it 's you ; you 're broken .
so how do we diagnose that conversation ?
he was five at the time .
the saudi authorities remained very quiet .
that really cree@@ ped us out .
so it 's a totally different picture .
they even started a poll .
i learned to be always there .
it 's about women themselves .
but i am also for sustainability .
and we all look forward to those things .
these things are continuing to happen .
and this gives you an idea .
and they have dor@@ ms for the workers .
and the density is quite incredible .
10 hours a day at this speed .
this is a famous bridge in europe .
now , i 'm a sailor , obviously .
what 's wrong with this picture ?
it 's active in the gulf of guinea .
we see it in the caribbean .
here are photographs of two young men .
this is where al qaeda is staged from .
so here we are , 21st century .
we will need the application of military force .
this is afghanistan . these are afghan soldiers .
they are all holding books .
they 're all part of this .
" mom , i see the world . "
here you see baseball players .
got a little laugh from the audience .
now , let me hit a somber note .
he 's in the sco@@ ts guards .
i hope you will enjoy .
oh , you 're wi@@ ggling your toes .
a very special group of animals .
they 're our natural garbage collectors .
vultures also have tremendous historical significance .
they are bird-@@ blending machines .
we 're working with local communities .
find me when you can . "
my idea is : no ! no !
it probably has lies in it as well .
this is a klein bottle .
and it sent me back .
this guy over here of course is me .
in the background , my bicycle .
not just showing up every now and then .
no calculus , i 'll cut out that .
i 've got a frequency counter right here .
now , so i know the frequency .
i 've moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
the wavelength was 0.2 meters .
let 's figure out what this is .
pulls out a gun . goes boom !
this cop comes after me with a rifle .
he wants to clunk me over the head !
and that 's not really the case .
now let 's assume you go on holiday .
they could be quite mild .
so why is it spreading so fast ?
that 's two days ago .
well , there 's two principle ways .
it 's just not practical .
this is a picture of fo@@ gging .
you just want to get this one .
it 's just the female .
they only live a few days .
and that 's exactly where we are .
well , the result has been very good .
we can transport them around the world .
we 've separated the males from the females .
there 's 10,000 neurons here .
we need to rearrange the pattern .
but we 'll certainly learn a lot .
but these pores here are special .
she cut the heads off of her flies .
here 's some such cctv footage .
and the logic of our experiment was simple .
its behavior is completely unchanged .
this is one piece of good news .
ca : have you met anyone interesting ?
ca : that 's pretty good .
so , it all worked out well .
rb : i should have .
ca : and how many employees ?
ca : what was that one ?
rb : dropping in for tea .
i certainly would have failed iq tests .
and so the board meetings have been fascinating .
and i finally worked it all out .
ca : but is there a risk here ?
which of those happened first ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- ca : that 's great .
you 've been accused of being ruthless .
it 's got to be consistent .
ca : how old are you ?
rb : i 'm 56 .
it is simple and complex .
it is peaceful and violent .
that 's a cyclical process .
so , we get climate change .
so , how much would this cost ?
how do we construct something like this ?
but , what should they look like ?
that 's not true at all .
which one would you like the most ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
how many would opt for memory ?
some have come and gone .
but what will come in the future ?
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
i was trying to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
we have reached a kind of equi@@ poise .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
imagine then just two other little changes .
" hello ? hey . "
all right ? that 's the first time .
" hello ? uh , hey . "
" hello ? uh , who ?
we call these behavioral markers .
why is intel willing to fund that ?
it was right around new years .
and in fact , it 's upon us .
i just extended it . "
this is the first general hospital in vienna .
now , i 'm not anti-@@ hospital .
we 've got to focus on the home .
she tri@@ pped over her oxygen tank .
i ca n't stop this from happening .
it 's a research platform .
this is actually sensor fir@@ ings .
these are two different subjects in our study .
so , 10,000 households or bust .
it 's just a mess today .
-lrb- applause -rrb- this is a river .
this is happening all over the country .
this is prickly pear creek .
how did we get here ?
these senior water rights are key .
so they have no incentive to conserve .
it 's a broken system .
it 's a broken system .
but they have no incentive to do so .
that 's what 's happening here .
and most importantly , it 's working .
but it 's become something else .
and that might have been the case .
they have to obey four simple laws .
all of origami comes from that .
and yeah , you really can .
so let me stretch out that equation .
now the first step , pretty easy .
but we 're going to start small .
how would you make a single flap ?
i can use it for something else .
there are other dimensions for flaps .
so now we 're ready to scale up .
and it 's so simple .
or you could do a moose .
these techniques revolutionized this art .
i call it " snack time . "
and you can do more than just insects .
this tree frog has toes .
you can make multiple subjects .
so these are a couple of instrument@@ alists .
but i want to show you some examples .
so you have to do something like this .
this was a small model .
and this example is the latter .
this guy was back on his feet immediately .
that 's ken shar@@ pe over there .
they do n't understand us .
they fashion a novel solution to the problem .
wise people know how to improvise .
a wise person knows when to improvise .
it 's the case of michael .
michael 's a young guy .
he had a pretty low-@@ wage job .
then he lost his job .
he was a responsible husband and father .
all this would do is wreck a family .
and the family was united .
he did after all have a toy gun .
judge forer had to follow the law .
you need to have incentives .
people have to make a living .
he was busted in a drug sweep .
but judge russell did have an alternative .
why has the idea spread ?
they serv@@ iced the loans .
people want to be allowed to be virtuous .
even the earth warps space around it .
now look at the moon .
it really works . it describes the data .
and that is what got kaluza thinking .
amazing - it just popped out .
we do n't seem to see them .
and i hope you appreciate this .
they do n't produce different musical notes .
the different frequencies produce the different particles .
now here is the catch .
this is a deep question .
so can we explain those 20 numbers ?
let me show you how .
they have a very rich , intertwined geometry .
how would we know it ?
let me show you that idea visually .
but here 's how the experiment will go .
-lrb- applause -rrb- good afternoon , everybody .
i 've got something to show you .
let me tell you a bit about it .
it 's called " talk to me . "
here you see the city .
it 's morning , before the match .
you see the timeline on the top .
the match begins - silence .
france scores . italy scores .
second half . end of normal time .
you saw the big peak .
here are the results we just obtained .
-lrb- music -rrb- from seattle ...
this data was not available before .
so that was the reason for the project .
the whole building is made of water .
here 's the building working .
but then reality 's always unpredictable .
so you can have this cloud .
you can play with a different type .
and here you can see rober@@ to dancing .
so you can reconstruct a whole movement .
you can go all the way through .
it 's called the cloud .
so , they answered my emails .
it was a wonderful experience .
this was the worst month of my life .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so , that was hard .
you can just google it .
and i undertook this for two reasons .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so , not very .
so i wanted to follow those .
you only know if you try it .
how should we view the bible ?
how was the bible written ?
and it 's sort of evolved .
i went to the creationists ' museum .
and these are the ultimate liter@@ alists .
they really did a fantastic job .
it 's a remarkable thing .
third , that thou shall have reverence .
the sabbath can be sacred .
thank you . bless you , bless you .
so , this was very inspiring to me .
and i failed miser@@ ably .
there 's me reading the bible .
and then it was abandoned .
mayor giuliani wanted to tear it down .
it turns out we were wrong on that .
we opened the fist section in 2009 .
it 's been successful beyond our dreams .
this was just installed last month .
i refer to organized crime .
now it 's time for full disclosure .
the court system was n't functioning properly .
we prefer to know them as the mafia .
and where were they heading ?
take mexico , for example .
but what about the democratic republic of congo ?
and the answer is six vessels .
and it 's been terribly successful .
it 's really not that difficult .
they affect our bank accounts .
songs are written about cars .
he wrote about a car .
we wanted something that was really affordable .
and sequel truly is a real car .
and it can come from biofuels .
now that 's a lot of money .
and we talked about swarm networks earlier .
we find that premise quite exciting .
i just want to ask one .
there was just no future .
it 's been blessed . "
so we went to the teachers .
and that was run by them .
of course , it must be american cola .
so our work was n't affected .
so i said , " okay . "
so they were happy with that .
in taxis , you get condoms .
but i have some to give out afterward .
stop global warming ; use condoms .
90 percent of the funding came from thailand .
we all need to help .
so , that was done .
it 's not a free gift .
otherwise they 'll never get out of poverty .
and these are our thai tu@@ lips .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- thank you very much indeed .
now molecules are really , really tiny .
and by tiny , i mean really .
and this idea is actually nothing new .
and he transformed our understanding of the moon .
so this is a tran@@ section through blood .
and those red molecules are hemoglobin .
what would it look like ?
so again , we begin with dna .
it 's packaged up and bundled up .
one is bundled up into one sausage .
it is a signal broadcasting system .
and the going is pretty rough right now .
compassion is a worthy successor .
compassion cultiv@@ ates and practices curiosity .
compassion can be synonymous with empathy .
compassion also looks like this .
and compassion can also have those qualities .
well , he was complicated .
so was mother ter@@ esa .
this actually became my creative obsession .
now we have instant neighborhoods outside .
i mean , how nice is that ?
this is from my second book .
so it tends to get discoun@@ ted .
i like this for a couple of reasons .
this is working with marshall mcluhan .
so , this was the contents page originally .
it was a worldwide branding campaign .
this is some work from ray gun .
and this continued through the entire magazine .
it did not let up .
i 'm just not sure this is improvement .
i hope you 'll understand my english .
and every city has its own design .
and we are very close to my house .
and that 's the evolution of the system .
it 's not enough , a new materials .
i 'll speak on this later on .
the subway was against , of course .
and after , the children teach their parents .
and we can not have all the answers .
please , allow me just two minutes .
imagine that . 7,100 apples with names .
they gave them their name .
this book was published in 190@@ 4 .
and then he has to go even further .
is agriculture adapted to that ?
that 's at 78 degrees north .
it 's other@@ worldly , beautiful .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- in this place there .
it operates like a safety deposit box .
but it 's a necessary thing to do .
and we need to support it financially .
you believe i 'm looking at you .
but i 'm going to take some medication .
i 'll explain that in just a moment .
i will take enough of these . mm .
indeed , the whole container .
thirty-@@ two tablets of calms for@@ te .
i wonder if that 's true .
this is what they go through .
now , sylvia browne is the big operator .
we call her " the tal@@ ons . "
he just does n't care .
well , pretty well anyway .
hmm . you 've heard of it .
why do n't they affect me ?
he died of an overdose .
he forgot to take his pill .
maybe these people are just independently wealthy .
if you find out - now i understand .
that 's what they 're looking at .
it 's www.@@ ran@@ di@@ .org.
you will see the records that we have .
spiders are truly global citizens .
spiders are also extremely old .
and this is what we see .
these can be grou@@ ped into seven categories .
but what , exactly , is spider silk ?
think of hunting with silly string .
now , this tech incorporates three big elements .
dimitri , just wag@@ gle your arm around .
now , you notice he 's sitting .
so here he is walking through the grass .
so , he 's discovering the garden .
now we 've used the hand .
do you want milo to squash it ?
and we 'll do that in a second .
okay , this is ski@@ mming stones .
it 's all been too much for him .
they 're always getting stressed .
we do n't know anyone .
you cleaned up my room .
his mind is based in a cloud .
-lrb- video -rrb- man : okay .
he was an early tal@@ ker .
and so we started to analyze why .
why were certain words born before others ?
and the -lsb- horizontal -rsb- axis is time .
what about the visual context ?
he 's leaving red ink behind .
and so our effort took an unexpected turn .
and then the important third dimension .
and there are fascinating dynamics at play .
it 's not one way .
they talk to other people .
we 've given this person a name .
and he was quiet for a moment .
-lrb- video -rrb- dr : hey .
dr : ma , he 's walking .
so that 's what i have to say .
your voice so soft and muffled ...
i became bizar@@ rely popular .
" is there a sense of wonder ? "
and " does it invoke curiosity ? "
so here 's the word puzzle again .
and here it is with the abstract surrounding .
but maybe that 's a little too obvious .
the world is full of wonder .
these are my valentines from 2005 and 2006 .
there were four different versions of this .
impossible ? i do n't think so .
i know this makes you embarrassed .
" what does it say ? "
and " what does it do ? "
this is my third visit to ted .
and this gives me enormous hope .
and you know what i found out ?
we feel it at concerts .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so , here we are .
and i 'll read you what it is .
this is their wedding video .
you may have seen it .
i mean , who are these people ?
i totally want to go to that wedding .
there 's multiple music publishers .
great leaders dare to be different .
he never went back to school .
such is the power of self-@@ study .
and then something fascinating happened .
so here 's what dan said .
they have a tremendous passion to learn .
so for example , let 's take area .
but we discovered it by self-@@ exploration .
yeah , i 'll be a filmmaker . "
and it starts getting really nice .
and it completely threw science on its head .
there 's no hot water .
and this is the tropics .
it 's raining like crazy here .
look in your own backyard .
look in your heart , actually .
and do that , and spread the word .
and let me tell you this story .
they tried the usual psychotherapy .
they thought he had a really extraordinary future .
i could blow the depression away .
i stayed there for three years .
my children came back to live with us .
we had two more children after that .
you can be thrown off the track .
there is redemption . and there is resurrection .
our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
the earth moved for both of them .
the moral imperative is on the table .
let 's get creative against climate change .
and they are in our backyard .
would you explain the rules for admission ?
but there are only two rules .
so we came up with these two rules .
pm : you 're running a medical clinic .
you 're also running a civil society .
so dr. de@@ q@@ o has to explain .
i succeeded in my place .
and i 'm thankful for my daughters .
they do everything for them .
she always expects us to do more .
that 's the best part .
-lrb- applause -rrb- wait . wait .
my poem is called " dirt . "
her hand cla@@ wing at my head .
but oh , her soap !
this is called " the dress . "
it 's a longer poem .
it 's called " the neighbor . "
my sweet angels , come back . "
her wa@@ vering step into the world .
it 's called " gas . "
weight@@ fully upon me was the world .
i kept finding myself at her page .
no . again , no .
i do n't mean that for a moment .
v@@ amp . siren . seduc@@ tress .
i do n't know where we are now .
it 's not just going to disappear .
what 's your act two ?
and i said , " oh . "
you just tip your hand .
and what could go wrong ?
and we 're starting to make our way .
it 's out of print - still ...
they 're using pragmatic chaos now .
would n't that be handy ?
what would it look like ?
we 're designing for this machine dialect .
you can take it really , really far .
and that 's going to keep happening .
this is some mathematicians at mit .
that 's the place to be .
we had to beat the european monarchy .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
so it was not easy at all .
i want you all to imagine rio .
you 've got to think green and green .
cities are packed with people .
so how do you move these people around ?
but there is a problem .
the contractors , they do n't like that .
you can build nice stations .
this is a map of rio .
and this is the most controversial one .
all these red parts are favelas .
we call it a family clinic .
we have new year 's eve .
we have problems with the tropical rains .
so how 's the weather in rio now ?
let me get you our weather satellite radar .
ep : okay , how 's the traffic ?
you see , the streets are clear .
now it 's 11@@ :00 pm in rio .
nothing of concern in terms of traffic .
-lrb- applause -rrb- i love my food .
that was the family business .
and this is happening here .
do you go to a restaurant ?
and by this time i was hooked .
thank you very much for your time .
i was going to work with small farmers .
i was going to help alleviate poverty .
you could be in new york .
" i make ice cream . "
he said , " okay . "
it was a great success .
that gets your adrenaline going .
we were attacking the wrong driver .
so let 's go back to sudan .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- okay . fast forward .
we live on a planet .
there 's just one of them .
we may have some innovative , new ideas .
there 's no more of it .
now we 're at 1.3 .
this is where we stand today .
it 's always population growth .
we have six billion units of consumption .
but that 's what the math says .
we can get productivity up .
we can get efficiency up .
and then we need to consume less .
the average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the u.s.
and there are many others .
we need coke to work with pepsi .
we need oxford to work with cambridge .
but we ca n't do everything .
we have to work in these places .
again , a daunting task .
there must be a better way .
this is nine of them .
why is 25 percent important ?
we ca n't wait that long .
we do n't have that kind of time .
we need to begin to work with industries .
it 's not all fun and games .
eight entities came to the table .
it 's risk and demand .
so we 're pulling out all the stops .
it 's a pre-@@ competitive issue .
mars is also on a similar journey .
it 's more with less and less again .
that is an extern@@ ality by definition .
these companies have begun to think differently .
and i go on the podium .
-lrb- music -rrb- was that nice ?
um , he was happy .
and i often show this to senior management .
and then you have other stories , unseen .
people who build this wonderful concert hall .
he says , " i 'm responsible . "
did you see the hands ?
this is a german orchestra , yes ?
why are the eyes closed ?
-lrb- music -rrb- -lrb- laughter -rrb- yeah .
that 's what he does .
you have the plan in your head .
this is very exciting for those players .
you also have to be very professional .
can we have the next video , quickly ?
go along with the video . look .
-lrb- music -rrb- the whole orchestra is playing .
-lrb- music -rrb- now something else .
-lrb- music -rrb- look at the eyes .
okay . you see that ?
so kleiber is about process .
kleiber is about conditions in the world .
lenny bern@@ stein , my own personal maestro .
and you 're playing a painful sound .
and this is a global business .
and this is a business incubator .
this is o@@ sho@@ di market in lagos .
i do n't conceive of it that way .
there 's nothing underground about it .
this is the pickle economy .
and it 's not just in africa .
and then there 's mobile phones .
and where 's the air@@ time sold ?
and where do the phones come from ?
they 're going to eddy in lagos .
the name is a misnom@@ er .
now , are there downsides to that ?
ver@@ s@@ ace without the vo@@ wels .
z@@ hu@@ om@@ ani instead of armani .
now , there 's another problem .
cooperative development is a way forward .
they did n't know how to .
nuclei and nuclear reactions , of course .
or so we should hope .
now , what had changed ?
so , i 'll tell you .
all knowledge derives from the senses .
knowledge comes from the senses .
what 's wrong with us ?
we do n't see the origin of species .
but we know about those things .
some rocks and some fin@@ ches .
no one has ever seen evolution .
brains only detect nerve impulses .
consider the ancient greek myth explaining seasons .
and here is the crucial thing .
i want to know why they fish .
what 's the context of this meal ?
vegetables : they might yet save the oceans .
this is an easy sell .
there 's a pattern here .
this is what we need to favor .
this is what the green list says .
put it on four plates .
i expect a lot from food .
we need to savor vegetables .
and we need to save dinner .
we 're at the ocean .
they want to teach me about my destiny .
people will forget their wisdom .
it will sometimes be a lonely road .
it 's the home of my mentor .
this is part of our collective narrative .
it 's humanity 's dna .
we must cour@@ se-@@ correct .
true navigation begins in the human heart .
together , may we journey well .
-lrb- applause -rrb- mockingbirds are bad@@ ass .
and i 'm on this .
wait for the man with the mockingbird . "
-lrb- applause -rrb- chris anderson : wow .
anyone want to hazard a guess ?
and it 's almost impossible to perform .
alright . let 's leave that .
it 's called op@@ to-@@ isol@@ ator .
so it blinks one second after you do .
they 're called self-@@ settlers .
otherwise , i 'm going home . "
it 's incredibly difficult to parse .
home is a transient concept .
" if you leave , you die . "
they are dying of sadness . "
so let me tell you a story .
i had no practical skills .
so i did just that .
this is my passport from 2004 .
it 's like going to a night@@ club .
especially the aisle with cleaning products .
they have similar sound of eyes .
and here 's some music translated into color .
i would encourage you to become a cyborg .
i call it cognitive surplus .
cognitive surplus is made up of two things .
that 's the second half of cognitive surplus .
we still like to consume , of course .
what could be bad ? "
both of these rely on cognitive surplus .
we 've got a choice before us .
talk about a sweet beginning .
the water is turned into goo .
not quite an obvious alliance .
that 's what my home@@ girl is doing .
so i 'm so proud of that .
the numbers just are n't there .
these examples indicate a trend .
one journey from london to new york .
they make their own intra@@ ocular lenses .
and that connection is change .
what 's the design brief ?
many barriers are breaking down .
so how does it work ?
they were all 3d printed .
the design is quite extraordinary .
this is almost three meters high .
and you can actually walk into it .
so really the resolution is quite incredible .
now this is an engine component .
there 's a lower chance of rejection .
you 're having machines fabricate themselves .
brands like nike are doing it .
it 's all over the web .
and you can start iter@@ ating the design .
this means lower carbon footprint .
here 's the product being built .
so this is a plate of nachos .
they 're hard to just get automatically .
but where is this going ?
so here 's the next challenge .
br : thanks , guys .
you ca n't be smart and pretty .
i got about 3,000 emails .
but it 's also a morally important one .
so this small missing chunk here is puzzling .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it 's true .
-lrb- applause -rrb- i have excel .
-lrb- applause -rrb- or about 75,000 jobs .
the numbers are pretty crazy .
well , agriculture in america 's very interesting .
and their farms are also large .
and i 'm talking about the very end .
i 'm talking about dying .
i 'm not a geriatri@@ cian .
it starts with a plan .
hospital read@@ iness is critical .
tape a set to your refrigerator .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- by far .
there is no competition here .
they 're massive . they 're powerful .
adults can weigh up to 300 kilos .
i am swimming against the tide .
we really do , and you know what ?
these animals deserve to be cared for .
they need me . they need us .
i mean that simplicity sky .
this amazing person , muriel cooper .
you ca n't type very much on this .
my hair 's clean - it 's okay .
it does n't make any sense .
because i want to simplify them for you .
one was his daughter , la@@ ur@@ ence .
he became a je@@ suit .
he converted from his ang@@ li@@ can faith .
i still have two minutes .
they really needed the money .
imagine that was lake superior .
imagine that was lake hur@@ on .
it 's an extraordinary change .
let 's put it that way .
you can walk there today .
this is an environmental disaster wr@@ it large .
you see the canal they dug ?
and it rivals climate change in importance .
in fact , we completely depend on it .
more importantly , changing diets .
that 's almost the size of germany .
and we all need food .
but it 's not the only problem .
that 's the size of africa .
so where do we go from here ?
there is no single solution .
there are three important reasons .
we can ask a very concrete question .
is it capable of doing it ?
it had to improve it a little bit .
but the real big step was the neocortex .
and it has not stopped its evolutionary path .
how many trees does it have ?
what shapes are the trees ?
they choose very carefully who they connect with .
and you may have more or less neurons .
well , we do n't have to speculate .
we can use different neurons with different variations .
we can use less or more of them .
it 's the first view .
where is it inside the neocortex ?
but at any rate , they are there .
what is a conscious mind ?
but what about the self ?
and so that is a beginning .
but look at the arrows .
they 're not there for looks .
that 's where the difference is .
it is developed in the cultures .
this is 59 seconds into the film .
this is a minute 59 .
so they snapped into action .
and he invented the shipping container .
again , another medical example here .
this is people designing their own experiences .
you can draw from this .
so , what came out of this ?
it 's about this really .
they 're now called kickstart .
and that was completely irrelevant .
these guys are using this very successfully .
we feel that this is an important gesture .
i hope you 'll all wear them .
your house has caught fire .
spectroscopy , that was another one .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and there he is .
these extraordinary things , icelandic internet accounts .
it did n't have that kind of collateral .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- wonderful news .
how many people here are left-handed ?
and somebody was talking about metaphors on monday .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- thank you very much .
mandela , the great man mandela .
he 's been honored with a statue now .
now there are over 30,000 .
so penguins are amazing athletes .
and that 's what i came to study .
things die when there 's no food .
there were plenty of them .
so they were just minding their own business .
why are there even these penguins oiled ?
turbo 's never been fed .
this is really pretty weird . "
and now look at this : not friendly .
this is what jesus asked of us .
now i was pretty psyched .
i mean who can argue with that ?
their business trajectory would change .
they might be able to buy mosquito nets .
the money came in basically overnight .
we sent it over to uganda .
i hope that kiva can blur those lines .
so they 're not a donation .
i think we all already know that .
and it has no dna .
it is able to move around its environment .
it can follow chemical gradients .
this is a violent process .
maybe they could extract carbon dioxide .
they think big . okay ?
we 've observed this in the laboratory .
but let 's start at the beginning .
but this trend is less unambiguous .
this is a decrease by two-thirds .
take the example of northern ireland .
a final example : kosovo .
central among them are three .
do you actually want it online ?
it was quite pop@@ ularly attended .
we 're in good enough shape .
but do things that you love .
we 've scanned about 200,000 books .
this does n't make any sense .
but half of those were indian .
we 're not quite a youtube .
so we 're he@@ dging our bets here .
i went to prison - difficult .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
mk : i can help you .
no , that 's what i thought .
and it 's also very risky .
eating an entire bowl of cool whip .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's very risky .
i want to help you calm down .
that 's the two-@@ cent tour .
karen frank : we are a smaller brand .
kf : that 's a great question .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- woman : superior technology .
they need to tell me about my brand .
man : um , my brand ?
i like really nice clothes .
lawyer : i 'm a lawyer brand .
tom : i 'm tom .
a : tell me about this world .
i like things that are different .
tell me a little bit about that part .
what other brands are like that ?
or are you more of a down attribute ?
or are you more of a down attribute ?
are you mindful , sophisticated like 00@@ 7 ?
and ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
em@@ c presents : " embrace transparency . "
thank you very much , guys .
ms : that is a fantastic question .
let 's start with city hall .
you ever see one of these before ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- now that would never happen .
this is the cover story .
then you get to their political articles .
heroes : how do we view leadership ?
but most importantly , it 's voluntary .
political parties : oh boy .
we can open up city hall .
we can reform our electoral systems .
we can democratize our public spaces .
this is a treph@@ inated skull .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- now that is surgical thinking .
and we see new refined tools coming out .
they were still a mistrusted lot .
i mean who would put themselves through that ?
until anesthesia , the absence of sensation .
this was truly a revolution in surgery .
they died of massive infection .
but eventually they did come around .
these surgeries were actually now being effective .
and it really changed the landscape of surgery .
the learning curve was very long .
surgeons had to give up their 3d vision .
they had to give up their wri@@ sts .
and the instruments are essentially working backwards .
and cost is one of them .
i talked about the large , complicated robot .
but there are other barriers .
and you need to re-@@ set it up .
he 's a chee@@ ky little devil .
it 's not so simple .
we need to see beyond the surface .
this is a cancer surgery .
it will go , bind to the cancer .
and we can make those markers glow .
and we can look at cells directly .
we can heal the disease .
and that is not the case .
these mala@@ dies come for us all .
and that is my vision for your future .
it 's called kun@@ ene region .
this is where i 'm coming from .
we live a very traditional lifestyle .
i was born in 1971 .
it 's a very sad story .
" eh ? the poachers ? "
" yes . our poachers . "
and that was my father .
and here are the new ideas .
we learned these things from outsiders .
they were not people from outside .
these were our own people .
do n't walk out at night !
that 's most of us here .
and it 's a global phenomenon .
next time they will do better .
and that anticipation enhances their well@@ being .
so optimism changes subjective reality .
but it also changes objective reality .
it acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy .
so they learned quickly and efficiently .
this is my collaborator r@@ yota kan@@ ai .
the key here really is knowledge .
these have to be identified by scientific investigation .
it 's going to be different than here .
you are always there with other people .
thank you . john . that 's great .
you can have a baby in second life .
jh : and your question ?
jh : other questions ? right here .
the distribution amongst countries is extremely broad .
jh : last question . right here .
titus was a restaurant manager .
so what would you do at this point ?
it should have been over .
it did n't end that way .
he lost his fi@@ an@@ c@@ ée .
he was 35 years old .
you were frightened . you were crying .
and should we ever ban its use ?
we need independent corro@@ bor@@ ation .
why are we embedded in social networks ?
and how do they effect us ?
but the visual complexity is still very high .
every tie between them is a relationship .
why do we show our emotions ?
but they never look like this .
why do they not look like this ?
and now i 'm highlighting a few dots .
that 's my social experience . "
would you rather be c or d ?
now , what is the point of this ?
how does this help us understand ?
they are a kind of social capital .
so think about these two common objects .
the question is : what 's next ?
the first one is mass .
we shift the gravitational center of it .
we can play with the shape itself .
it 's like ta@@ pered to the downside .
the shape is the second thing .
the third thing operates on a different level .
think of a ham@@ ster in the pocket .
let me show you the living mobile phone .
so allow me to tell you about it .
so i have a brother , ga@@ vin .
he wanted to be a chef really badly .
and he wanted one so badly .
and this discouraged my brother a lot .
and you can make that change .
it 's been a roller coaster ride .
one of them was the remarkable gharial .
and it is a marvelous rain forest .
it really changed my life totally .
what 's the point of all this ?
so , the tiger is the icon .
you drink it in peril of your life .
why ? how could it happen ?
this is a relatively clean river .
and it 's a horribly painful death .
the chambal river is an absolutely incredible place .
and it 's a bleak future for them .
so , people talk about political will .
so , we can do it .
how do you really get them to care ?
it 's not like the teddy bear .
this guy specializes in pit vi@@ pers .
then i got a scoop .
the scoop was quite a very simple story .
i am an undercover journalist .
but my colleagues did n't know .
i 've never stepped there before .
i have not done any business with anybody .
and here was him , denying .
aaa : that was my president .
i have been undercover in the prisons .
i have been there for a long time .
how can you obtain the hard core evidence ?
toilet facilities : very bad .
show me the evidence . "
i have some questions for you .
aaa : yes , yes .
i mean , everybody has their hazard .
others think about mal@@ thu@@ sian nightmares .
this is not a negotiable thing , hunger .
we know how to fix hunger .
we actually have the technology and systems .
their brains and bodies will be stunted .
and this is climate-@@ proof .
so is this a hopeless cause ?
and the food banks are growing .
we certainly saw that in 2008 .
the shop@@ keepers are hiring more people .
and we 're seeing nations in africa .
-lrb- applause -rrb- i love to collect things .
it 's a difficult choice , right ?
i mean , you lose .
and they take this stuff seriously .
go on , something should happen now .
well , i 've got news for you .
you know , " sit , sit . "
we use the pre@@ mack principle .
" sit , " sniff butt .
and now the dog 's really happy .
the breaks got fewer and fewer .
the behavior problem was going away .
she never raised her voice .
so , where do we go from here ?
we want a better way .
" johnny , do n't do that . "
kick , kick , kick .
i 'm standing right here with my bag .
and this is what it 's all about .
these relationship skills are so easy .
you know , calculus is wonderful .
your kids are easy to train .
that is such a powerful training technique .
this should be taught in schools .
relationships - how do you negotiate ?
i step on the brake .
i slammed on the brakes .
you 're in this extended body .
but occasionally we miss something .
and i believe that . i believe that .
you may think that 's impossible .
often they travel on pre-@@ published routes .
that 's very nice about them .
so how do we get there ?
i can tell you exactly what happens .
that guy could be a problem .
and you can predict the new trajectory .
fundamentally , these technologies exist today .
so let your car gossip about you .
hopefully it wo n't stu@@ tter .
i was born with some form of disease .
voice : what kind of disease ?
bp : i was born old .
man : i 'm sorry .
girl : are you sick ?
bb : there were many changes ...
i felt pretty good , considering .
he needed to be a very sympathetic character .
and we did it in about five weeks .
but we did know one thing .
we did about 325 shots .
i 'll give you an example here .
that 's not terribly compelling .
it seemed to be infinite .
and so we looped the scenes .
he watched again and again .
we encouraged him to improvise .
it was a long process .
we had to create a lighting system .
we also had to create an eye system .
the skin had to be absolutely accurate .
but , that is benjamin . thank you .
it 's the second world war .
he does n't know how to cure it .
and he 's operating in a hostile environment .
he said he heard suspicious laughter .
so the situation seemed pretty desperate .
it looks like crude oil .
and he had a name for it .
he called it the god complex .
i see it in our business leaders .
well let me give you an example .
and it 's wonderful , wonderful work .
and i 'm just counting toa@@ sters here .
the complexity here is unbelievable .
you could count them in five minutes .
and we have a problem-solving technique that works .
this baby was produced through trial and error .
you could use it in an industrial context .
you create a spray of detergent .
you sell it at a supermarket .
you make lots of money .
how do you design that nozzle ?
it turns out to be very important .
even this problem , too complicated .
you create 10 variations on that one .
you try out 10 variations on that one .
that is a huge failure rate .
obviously experimentation is very important .
so i say , okay , fine .
you think it 's obvious ?
i want to fix our education system .
i have half a dozen ideas .
then we 'll test some other ideas out .
they 're not statistically significant .
they should be in hospital . "
shut it down at once . "
and there 's this huge hub@@ bu@@ b .
archie lets it die down .
but it was always a conjecture .
he made a lot of mistakes .
" you see that stone wall out there ?
we 're born for them .
stories af@@ firm who we are .
thing only opens from the inside .
come , let 's go inside .
we 're born problem sol@@ vers .
and it 's like a magnet .
make the audience put things together .
they 're learning who they are .
and you 're still learning who you are .
so we 're all learning all the time .
hey , off the bed !
slinky ? s@@ link ... slinky !
get up here and do your job .
woody : what ? am i hearing correctly ?
you do n't think i was right ?
after that , all bets are off .
i could n't get enough of it .
cyclist : who are you ?
ha ha . no , no , no .
it ca n't be artificially evo@@ ked .
the best stories infuse wonder .
it 's okay , daddy 's here .
he ran and worked in a factory .
my grandmother was a hom@@ emaker .
and so these characters would become my friends .
and i just flourished here .
so how did i make friends ?
mr. green@@ wood was not pleased .
just stop drawing in my class . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and a video camera .
i just wanted a video camera .
they sold out of all of their books .
i have 10 picture books out .
and i meet bagh@@ eads .
and brian 's shoulders sank .
and i wonder how often that happens .
and they 're just so uncomfortable .
and he 's just a lovely guy .
and it was really enjoyable , really interesting .
in fact , everything was better than fine .
and they were holding it in their laps .
i love that term : guided mastery .
they just gained a new confidence .
doug diet@@ z is a technical person .
he was saving lives with this machine .
and this is what he came up with .
and the results were super dramatic .
and the hospital and ge were happy too .
so the quantitative results were great .
but you think about other things .
i survived , just so you know .
and they just make better decisions .
but they would n't give me an answer .
so that 's about 50,000 people affected .
this is samuel . he 's a farmer .
it should n't be that difficult .
now , let me ask you another question .
such a service simply do not exist .
and it is an absolutely virgin market .
what gives us the courage ?
somebody who had applied for the passport .
and he did not want to pay .
so , it actually works .
for example , i want to use zipcar .
zipcar got some really important things right .
they picked these sexy cars .
because it just creates more flexibility .
and honestly , it 's full of surprises .
that space is not vital .
and this is a very mesh-@@ y thing .
so this is an example .
they made a lot of mistakes .
they had some number of big successes .
and that 's exactly what i 'm saying .
these are called tau tau .
it 's called the sun@@ ga ' .
and his death will be greatly mour@@ ned .
his story is their story .
darwin had this amazing idea .
do you think there could ?
it 's all just the same thing happening .
and another 100 pages later .
if , if , if , then .
what do you think my favorite word is ?
sb : no , not without .
this is what makes it so amazing .
must is my favorite word there .
ah , yes , there is .
this is design process going on .
he wanted a name for the new replicator .
so , let 's see some memes .
you probably went out and bought them .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- what is this one doing ?
now , why is this important ?
language must have been useful for the genes .
copying with variation and selection .
but that 's not all .
we have a new kind of memes now .
let 's call them techno-@@ memes or temes .
because every step is dangerous .
getting a new replicator is dangerous .
we may take the ga@@ ian view .
that was dangerous , all right .
you know all about big brains .
it 's a really expensive organ to run .
why ? because it 's producing the memes .
but maybe it nearly did .
has it been tried before ?
what about all those other species ?
what happened to the others ?
we are the old machines .
and why would they do that ?
they could carry on without us .
so , those are the two possibilities .
maybe we will , maybe we wo n't .
but that 's just the beginning .
this is already available today .
this is now a little tiny patch .
now , i have this device on .
that 's where this is all starting .
well , i tried this device .
but i got the fit@@ bit .
how long did you do it for ? "
and the wake time is in orange .
and i 'm trying to play pos@@ sum .
this thing is very , very impressive .
it 's like a managed competition of sleep .
san diego is an extraordinary place for this .
each of these has a sensor .
we really ca n't see very far .
but there are some exceptions .
this is a bad situation .
the world is mostly blue .
nobody sang the old ones .
that 's shown down here .
you only hear the low frequencies .
but you can still hear that faint call .
i 'll describe a couple strategies .
it 's a really important problem .
but collision is a serious problem .
the shipping lanes have been moved .
so it 's very promising , actually .
but then they often wait there .
they could slow down by about 50 percent .
is it really just us ?
so , what exactly is seti ?
the numbers suggest a universe of possibilities .
alright , one billion stars .
well , what about 10 ^ 22 ?
where 's the line that marks that ?
so , there are many possibilities .
this is a very good year .
so , we have a fulfillment problem .
that brings me to my wish .
and you even find a church .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you very much .
what do i mean by fluent ?
and that triggered a debate in the u.k.
and it 's the same thing with coding .
you learn more about how computers work .
but that 's just where it starts .
let me show you an example .
he wanted to keep score .
very few people become professional writers .
let me end with just one more example .
okay , that 's the majority .
and here 's what bradley said about it .
some shut down the self using meditation .
now profane is the opposite of sacred .
it just means ordinary or common .
we want to satisfy our individual desires .
we pursue our individual goals .
so let me summarize where we are .
well let me show you .
let me illustrate this for you .
so here 's how things play out .
the free-@@ riders have taken over .
it 's not that hard a problem .
those things came along too recently .
this is why politics is so tribal .
what should i do with my life ?
they 're all searching for their staircase .
this is a dream of the ages .
it 's quite a cute little fellow .
now get out your handker@@ chiefs here .
but everything else is just lying there .
the animal 's clearly in the nursing home .
and now here is the daf-2 mutant .
so what is the daf-2 gene ?
and the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor .
that 's what that arrow means .
so this is altogether really , really interesting .
so what kind of hormones are these ?
the receptor is n't working as well .
so foxo turns on a lot of genes .
and the immune system is more active .
so what about the normal worm ?
but what good is this for the worm ?
then they promote the uptake of nutrients .
so this is really exciting to me .
let me get this straight .
you could change the genes in principle .
there is n't the technology to do that .
and they grow to be about this size .
ck : yes , that 's right .
it 's more like that .
everything in the kitchen was salvaged .
this is going up into the turret .
it 's a two-@@ person tub .
it 's a pretty panel of glass .
so do n't put it there .
do n't put it in the foyer .
but you 've never seen this one before .
that 's not a cell phone .
that 's how we process information .
so , that serves me every day .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's the difference .
we create mountains of waste .
well , that 's just a myth .
and that 's what happened there .
are we just being numb@@ ingly stupid ?
the walls are this thick .
" woo . woo@@ hoo@@ o . "
it 's a pretty quick read .
in there he talked about the divided self .
that happens in the building industry as well .
human beings are a social species .
human beings are like that .
you 're not one of the beautiful people .
video games are not the cause .
video games are a symptom .
" all right . okay . "
he 's just a little boy .
now what 's the problem with this ?
women are great . yep , absolutely .
this is a place for girls .
are there men around that table ?
that 's what she tells them .
have you seen the ads ?
we can design better games .
they 're glorified drill and practice .
all of those conversations need to be happening .
it was n't for me .
it knows how much it 's moving .
it 's just a robot .
it 's an honor to be here .
data : pretty lucky for them .
one of them falls to the ground .
he does not seem to be breathing .
what can i do ? "
because it 's neither rare nor well done .
data : i find it incredibly educational .
was that okay for my first time ?
it 's really a huge challenge for us .
it 's a fantastic device .
we 're facing this problem .
there is the problem . "
so this is really what we 're doing .
and this is a challenge .
i want to look at the heart .
this is as of 9 a.m. this morning .
she 's playing a computer game .
that 's where those artifacts are coming from .
so these are fantastic images .
so this is from a virtual autopsy .
it really just works like a huge iphone .
so it 's a very nice little device .
it 's really a hands-on experience .
and so i can generate a force feedback .
so i can feel the skin .
now this is really an interesting project .
he 's seeing his own brain .
these visualizations are brand new .
this is another sequence of motts ' brain .
and then he 's going backwards .
i can look inside of it .
so be aware of the bear .
so , some very talented people .
and all this had come from nothing .
the date was february 2000 .
and it was gut wrenching .
are we the victims of a mass delusion ?
i think it will be great .
i 'm incredibly excited about that .
that is a human tragedy .
why did america get serious ?
so , total reversal of trade policy .
is that easier or harder ?
so there 's the optimism .
and how about the long run ?
they still go up in the short run .
they have n't got them .
why on earth are they not there ?
that climate plays no role .
this is just completely ridiculous . "
can you get me some information ?
we did it in three steps .
what would that tell us ?
so we plot data for sample on this .
we did n't really understand that .
this was n't supposed to happen .
so we went a little wider .
how do we explain this ?
we can run these simulations .
how do we end a war like iraq ?
what does it look like ?
and this tells me one of two things .
so close your eyes for a minute .
okay , open your eyes .
this is a dry lake bed .
it 's an object for the mind .
is it luck ? is it chance ?
children became more competent , and less helpless .
show us the grades . "
so , how did the city respond ?
it gets taken over by children .
look at what their parents says .
man : this program is wonderful .
see ? they have done it .
girl : thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
street plays , auc@@ tions , peti@@ tions .
so , how can we still stay immune ?
and now we 've got the digital revolution .
this is david and erik .
black@@ outs are not fun .
mobile connectivity in africa is pervasive .
it is not without challenge .
" what are you carrying ? "
i could only find these ones .
victoria ? yes , correct .
that spike was all victoria .
hundreds ? one , three .
they were holding something like 700 people hostage .
i checked the reports on this one .
so why is this relevant ?
but the king was serious .
how many know him ? anybody ?
do we pursue happiness with hostility ?
good question . but back to bhutan .
but all of those questions are tangible .
we 're not asking meaningful metrics .
we 're not asking important questions .
we 're not asking anything that 's intangible .
we 've been fooled by our tool .
gdp has been our hammer .
they are n't the same .
what can you start counting today ?
all of these are experiences .
you know the words i mean ?
they say , you americans .
becoming the basis of the economy .
getting the commodities to market .
but is it really true to itself ?
right ? is it really in the city ?
we wo n't talk about santa claus then .
right ? just wonderfully true to itself .
so , it 's a fake real .
so , you have to understand that past .
for people to experience who you are .
here is my father at age 19 .
i heard him come in .
indeed , it 's rather small .
i was born in algeria .
my father , a secret agent ?
it was very james bond .
his parents were of russian descent .
he started making rubber stamps .
he was broke all of the time .
and then he would not come .
then one day he totally disappeared .
there was also latin america .
it did not start that trend .
but that 's not how it happens .
why are you still standing there ?
so try to meet that bar .
that 's hollywood for you .
so let 's look at the numbers .
eleven . it 's not bad .
here 's what it said .
they 're throwing it up in the air .
i think these people are experts .
i want more que@@ sts like that .
that sounds complicated , right ?
but what is electrical resistance ?
it 's quite remarkable . think about it .
but there was no evidence .
now , the good news .
it 's a new telescope .
so , what have we learned ?
we do that in our solar system .
and that 's what the frustration was .
the copernican dream was unfulfilled .
most of these are candidates .
but the statistical result is loud and clear .
it 's about 100 million such planets .
that 's great news . why ?
that 's not why i 'm here .
this pixel is the earth .
it is the earth as we know it .
but it 's really tiny .
can you imagine how small it is ?
we ca n't imagine it .
so what does this tell us ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- well , good morning .
would you like if i used the machine ?
journalist : what about that , admiral ?
c@@ b : looks very good to me .
here 's their marketing video .
this is a really good example of that .
come on into the secret lab .
there was women 's liberation .
and into that ferment came the microprocessor .
here 's the apple marketing video .
and the forces of convergence exploded .
finally , four great industrial sectors combined .
thomas edison had the same problem .
so many people are there .
the intensity of the up@@ spring .
and expression also , it has brought talents .
is it going to be another somalia ?
but there 's so much potential .
i wish i could show you my yemen .
he would say we are equal .
and he was such an extraordinary man .
a story : i studied in india .
it was very hard at first .
i 've tried to encourage young girls .
and i am a role model in yemen .
a lot of people look up to me .
you can be yourself and have your face .
and very , very difficult times .
some of my reporters were arrested .
we had some court cases .
we 've created the credibility .
and that 's not fair .
i 'm not so old .
na : shake@@ the@@ du@@ st@@ .org.
you spoke about the responsibility of the press .
na : on twitter also .
pm : so you are plugged in .
i wanted to visualize the story of life .
but there were also revelations .
it arises around cracks in the earth .
and they changed the atmosphere .
circuit boards of the future .
life flourished in swa@@ mps .
some mammals turned back to water .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you . thank you .
for over 50 years she ran it .
can we run that , andrew ?
sp : i agree with the president .
so , what are the solutions ?
number eight : the ecosystem collapses .
number six : biotech disaster .
oh , and here 's one other thing .
you do n't need that much up there .
and also , space is incredibly vast .
nothing to worry about , right ?
andrew , can you put that chart up ?
now look at the one right below that .
passenger aircraft crash , one in 20,000 .
could we have the solutions ?
and they 're trying to do that .
we really need a dedicated observatory .
yi@@ kes ! so many big threats !
but we have a major shortage of organs .
this is actually a very stunning statistic .
so , what can we do about it ?
we 've talked about stem cells tonight .
that 's a way to do it .
you see here a little video .
you see the scar form .
actually , we can regenerate .
your skin re@@ generates every two weeks .
so , your body is constantly re@@ generating .
the challenge occurs when there is an injury .
so , how can we harness that power ?
and you see that it is injured .
that 's exactly what you see here .
we used that biomaterial in the middle .
it disintegr@@ ates a few months later .
this is actually an engineered blood vessel .
you place the muscle cells on the outside .
so , the bladder is one such organ .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it 's true .
we exercise these prior to implan@@ tation .
this is actually your typical desktop printer .
and that 's actually what you 're seeing .
so , these are very tough technologies .
but it takes a lot to get there .
we are just taking five seconds .
so we did an experiment .
but i did n't find any .
so how 'd they figure this out ?
you 've probably heard of it .
there 's just one problem .
but we 're not there yet .
so here 's where you come in .
some images from mars , 1997 .
they had to make up everything .
12 to 15 launches per year .
-lrb- video -rrb- pilot : release our fire .
richard sear@@ fo@@ ss : good luck .
we 're based down in florida .
that 's our value proposition in a prize .
so , prizes work great .
well , it must be a good idea .
we 're going after an orbital prize .
a double outhouse over here on the side .
well , she and i went blackberry picking .
well , we 'll get married next thanksgiving .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you , michael .
i fell in love with that .
so i went back that very summer .
you can imagine how excited they were .
and you can look at more pictures .
it sounds something like this .
ai n't that a sound ?
she was n't going to give up .
good news : chariot 's coming .
good news : chariot 's coming .
no , we learned something else .
good news : chariot 's coming .
good news : chariot 's coming .
good news : chariot 's coming .
good news : chariot 's coming .
good news : chariot 's coming .
my mom was in the audience .
good news : chariot 's coming .
good news : chariot 's coming .
this instrument pretty much saved my life .
lord , i hate to hear that news .
they were about my age .
they have been saying that since the 1970s .
this is from july , 1969 .
three days of fun and music .
he said - think about this one .
the question was , where from ?
so i went in for an ultrasound .
my wife came with me .
i also found my wife online .
where does medical ability end and start ?
almost all patients are incurable . "
i did n't feel sick at all .
i was facing the grave .
her boyfriend was with her .
get yourself to a specialist center .
-lrb- applause -rrb- here 's the thing .
it 's the power of patient networks .
so we went into it .
do n't worry about the numbers .
you see , that 's the immune system .
patients are such an underutilized resource .
and it goes like this .
what did google come out with this year ?
it 's not my data .
she pulled up the cd .
how big a deal was this ?
we wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere .
and also the acoustic separation was destroyed .
moving along to lincoln center .
now , nobody wants an operation .
who here has had surgery ?
so let 's see what it looks like .
you can see it in their faces .
surgeons are not made either .
surgeons are trained one step at a time .
we ca n't travel everywhere .
so i was inspired by a friend .
let me bring it to you locally .
i work at the cambridge hospital .
it 's a big labor-intensive effort .
we need a universal translator .
it 's really about setting up a dialogue .
we have a lot to learn .
maybe we have something to learn as well .
and it has to be bi-@@ directional .
it 's a big task .
i need to have a health care lexicon .
we work with a fourth technology .
module five : manual skills practice .
but that 's the lectures .
this is how you hold the needle .
grab the needle at the tip .
it 's important to be accurate .
aim for the black dots .
now go ahead and cut .
we want it to be bi-@@ directional .
this is a ubiquitous tool .
they were responding to immediate concerns .
and this is when it really gets interesting .
what about the origins of agriculture ?
it was simply awful for women .
and politically , it was awful .
and that 's all very true .
that was the pai@@ ge type@@ se@@ tter .
it could benefit from tragedies .
so they re@@ formulated the bacter@@ icide .
think of the financial world , for example .
i 've recorded lots of cds .
we grew up without a television .
i starts out with a slow air .
dl : with one minute .
nm : with one minute .
we 've got another 10 minutes .
nm : well , um ...
nm : not too fast .
we had a great opportunity .
sorry , i hate to carry on ...
so let 's start talking about that .
we all love santa claus , right ?
we 're going to start to pay them .
and he gave an interview in december .
and then all bets are off .
let me show you what it looks like .
and it 's 10 tri@@ li@@ ion dollars .
your 401 -lrb- k -rrb- just got nailed .
sixty-@@ eight is young today .
i got what you 're thinking .
that 's the financial crisis .
so , cells have this cycle .
first they do n't grow .
and that was very cool stuff back then .
it 's almost like leaving congress .
this should not surprise you , right ?
you re-grow a set of teeth .
she 's now running around with her kids .
this is kind of getting boring , right ?
but , i mean it gets more interesting .
this may be one of the ultimate papers .
it is common for hominids to evolve .
that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint .
and so we struck up a deal .
and we were in for our first surprise .
it 's a very beautiful structure .
and that was what really got me puzzled .
and what that is , is cavitation .
that happens to be our cafeteria line .
that 's our dining room .
we even teach people how to read .
and that worked out all right .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- every building has a fountain .
and mellon bank 's a tenant .
thank you very much for that . "
and finally , there 's this picture .
this is in a place called san francisco .
i want one of those . "
my name 's willie brown . "
i want to help you . "
i 'm going with you , man . "
do the math - it will never work .
and she 's talking to her baby .
a six-@@ mon@@ ther ado@@ res the task .
we 're cul@@ ture-@@ bound listeners .
so there are two things going on .
english has a lot of rs and ls .
what did we do to their brains ?
so this is little emma .
you can see , she can move around .
it 's a technical tour de force .
we 're seeing the baby brain .
can that possibly be true ?
ca : how does it work ?
how do people release the documents ?
and how do you secure their privacy ?
if we can have this document up ...
it 's the holy grail of kenyan journalism .
and so it came in from the outside .
roger . i got ' em .
i mean , did he ?
what would you say to that ?
who 's got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
is it really yours ? "
ja : what , the movie business ?
so you have to be careful with hacker .
iceland went through this financial crisis .
-lrb- applause -rrb- last question , julian .
and i 'm going to demonstrate for you .
that 's what it feels like to me .
and that 's what the song is asking .
it does n't have a name yet .
i think - how can this possibly be ?
is it truly possible to study creativity scientifically ?
and so it gets down to the brain .
that was not what was going on .
so this is a twel@@ ve-@@ bar blues .
this is one subject 's data .
so how do you study rap scientifically ?
he does n't know what 's coming .
so o@@ zz@@ ie , harriet and me .
you 're all welcome to join .
i mean this is the iphone 4 .
now i mentioned the phone .
how do you leverage that information ?
so even my stethoscope is now digital .
you can step on the scale .
we have wireless blood pressure cu@@ ffs .
but it 's going to be here .
how about augmenting the physician ?
now how about controlling other elements ?
now how about other expon@@ entials ?
you can swallow this completely integrated device .
these are shrinking even further .
these are going to be game changing .
it might change my behavior .
we can capture that information .
so i 'll finish up with exponentially better .
so we 're attacking the wrong target .
host : thank you . thank you .
it makes a huge difference .
which will happen around 2020 .
we 'll then go to the next paradigm .
but we more than make up for that .
this is a completely different example .
but this has progressed at an exponential pace .
this is deeply democra@@ tizing .
but where will we get the software ?
well this is a logarithmic graph .
and so that 's what we 've done .
here is our founding meeting .
but this is being announced today .
this is an exciting new venture .
so what does this all mean ?
we can inspire each other .
now these are stories from basic science .
and this is happening right now , today .
the results were un@@ available to them .
anybody ? anybody ? yeah !
i 'd never seen anything like that .
i grew up in a musical family .
online videos and social networking ...
and this is happening every day .
ladies and gentlemen : the l@@ x@@ d .
did i mention they 're gorgeous ?
they were developed in japan pretty recently .
okay , induced pluripotent stem cells .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and this .
it does n't necessarily predict a win-win outcome .
now , back to the unfolding apocalypse .
so that is a non-zero-sum dynamic .
i 'm just doing what i can here .
in this case , it 's very simple .
so this is very surprising .
what happened to the neanderthals ?
did we mix or not ?
and that 's indeed the case .
why do we call it that ?
they 're going to be small .
he 's now a one star general .
let 's talk about a battle space .
a banana peel on the tarmac .
we asked the russians for 40,000 .
we face different opponents across these three .
it 's just too damn hard .
we have a brilliant secretary of war .
i call that the leviathan force .
i call them the system administrators .
they can indi@@ ct your ass .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- but here 's the deal .
that 's called the powell doctrine .
just as we rush in .
what do you get then ?
and then they turned on us .
check out their agenda since 9/11 .
we did it just like that .
would you like mu@@ gab@@ e gone ?
would you like a better system ?
actually , most of them .
bad pentagon , bad ! "
it 's not our system of governance .
i prefer that phrase system administration .
it makes me very popular as well .
everybody 's got an opinion .
security has meant everything else .
a big stick , a baton stick .
that 's not our problem now .
that 's the scary part .
i supported the war in iraq .
this is the hob@@ be@@ sian force .
the rule is going to be this .
we 're done with that .
different definitions of network centri@@ city .
do we need a bigger budget ?
here 's the larger point .
who gets custody of the kids ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- read max boon .
i want them to be marines .
it keeps it from being the u.n.
sh@@ inse@@ ki was right with the argument .
trigger-@@ pul@@ lers go this way .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i was never here .
this is not about money .
notably mars , as a first example .
so , back to mars .
and so this is very exciting news .
so , what about life on mars ?
so this is a very bold statement .
so why might it be hard to find ?
it 's bursting with life .
this is very unusual for caves .
this stuff is produced biologically .
these are h@@ opping mic@@ robot swarms .
and these allow them to hop .
let 's start with mortgages .
and then they fore@@ close .
we were risk takers , of course .
how many of you have iphones ?
what if you lose your iphone ?
how many of you have kids ?
i see a lot of hands coming down .
and i know it sounds crazy .
so where does it take us ?
they can not make savings easy .
they 're just too lazy .
one out of 10 are saving enough .
what are we going to do about it ?
who would go for bananas ?
wonderful study comparing different countries .
not many people like checking boxes .
it takes effort . you need to think .
well , you still have choice .
that 's kind of too much effort .
doing nothing is very common .
not many people check boxes .
in germany , 12 percent check the box .
twelve percent are organ donors .
inertia , lack of action .
and checking the box takes effort .
they still have an apple left .
why have you taken our apple ?
save more tomorrow makes it easy .
saving more today is not an option .
this is a real difference .
let me wrap with two key messages .
this is just one example .
one , two , three , four .
that 's understandable and important .
the key components are already widely available .
and that 's worth noting in particular .
this would be someone who 's entirely intuitive .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and i 've never seen them .
this is a photograph of the object .
here , let me give you an analogy .
and so we measured its motion .
so let 's think about the atoms .
i think this is really cool .
there will be no exceptions to that .
we have machines that go ping .
there 's many of them up there .
his is the little hand .
now , i work in acute care .
this is john hunter hospital .
sudden death has become very rare .
the big growth industry are these .
it 's an amazing picture .
the cultural issue had reasser@@ ted itself .
so that 's the little idea .
now , i 'm an aging hippie .
she founded the hospice movement .
it 's you . it 's me .
it 's our invisible reality .
what could be our real needs ?
it seems to be magic .
and in mine , i hope .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it works .
you feel the effect of the white noise ?
it 's too in silence .
so , definitely not perfect .
and db will probably roll toward you .
so , a huge problem .
and together we improve the original concept .
and we build the project to the end .
i just do that to make money .
so we took too many of them .
i 'm going to give you some example .
so , you start with the darkest one .
and here you can get the white core .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
i remember the day of the opening .
i was a little bit late .
so this is the final object .
it will be launched next september .
and it includes some fishes as well .
after that you have two options .
so now we can breathe safely .
now we can eat local food .
see , like this one ?
you can see it there .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- just for my workshop .
look at the client base for this .
nuclear is and has been for 40 years .
they 've run out of good sites .
the power lines are getting over@@ loaded .
solar 's wonderful on rooftops .
this is one from to@@ shi@@ ba .
they 're referred to as nuclear batteries .
-lrb- applause -rrb- ca : okay . okay .
mark jacob@@ son : thank you .
and it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation .
so , do we need this ?
the spacing is something else .
here are the world wind resources .
so then here 's the final ranking .
-lrb- applause -rrb- ca : all right .
if you 're against , put up one .
that 's from real data .
i used to be against nuclear power .
be very aware of the propaganda .
secondly , think about this .
anyone else for ? go .
i will also add one other thing .
ca : point well made . thank you .
none of those things were stirring .
fifteen percent of the entire u.s.
all those in favor , raise your hands .
-lrb- shouts -rrb- and all those against .
now that is - my take on that ...
" absolutely , " i said .
it 's hard to over@@ state the destruction .
there 's almost nothing left .
it does n't taste very good either .
" best in the business . "
2.5 to one , great .
the chef had over@@ cooked it .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
i ca n't , but this guy can .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
they reversed the flow of water .
they literally flipped the switch .
i 'm an expert in relationships . "
he pointed at the algae .
but what are your fish eating ?
what 's the feed conversion ratio ? "
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- no kidding .
i almost never cook with it .
how are you going to feed the world ?
i do n't love that question .
one billion people will go hungry today .
want to feed the world ?
look to miguel , farmers like miguel .
it 's really just been basic demographics .
they can make some educated guesses .
this is far too simplistic .
can you even imagine what that looks like ?
guess who was the performing guest ?
it means " green onion for free . "
so we do a lot of things .
i was representing the shanghai expo .
it 's very complicated to explain .
on ten@@ cent , 200 million .
so how are they different ?
these diagrams show a more general social background .
china is soon to pass the u.s.
they 're not rich at all .
so i was very surprised about this .
is it worth it to you ?
how will you cook your chicken now ?
and that was my first science fair project .
it got a bit more complicated from there .
got rejected by all except one .
one in 100 will die from it .
it 's a huge problem .
one death every 20 seconds .
and this can be used by anyone .
-lrb- applause -rrb- lisa ling : right .
your google science fair champions .
there 's no comparison at all .
this is what 's going on .
what are the risk factors ?
we take care of everyone .
we get the generators from the companies .
the patient does n't have to travel .
we encourage them to bring children .
so we are pleased with that .
when have you been appointed to play god ?
and they rang very true for me .
every single dog on one tee shirt .
and then just leave it all to them .
and i do n't have to do anything .
so i looked for furniture .
it 's not quite finished yet .
it includes 3@@ 30 compas@@ ses .
his restaurant is open seven months every year .
his latest numbers are fairly impressive .
there is some good successes .
that 's about five percent of everybody .
so i became my own intern .
what came out of it ?
i really got close to design again .
so then it became quite easy .
that 's connected to a scanner .
it has a more transparent identity .
the truck they go on tour with .
you can grow it underneath the skin .
my parents are both sales@@ people .
there must be something else .
i 'll just show two now .
this is after a week .
it 's a movie about happiness .
they were n't quite slick enough .
just a bit too ornamental .
so it 's going to be a while .
ste@@ fan sag@@ me@@ ister : thank you .
people cross oceans to go see them .
these are the maa@@ sa@@ is .
the girls are brought up to be mothers .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- cool , yeah ?
why did she say that ?
so i wanted to become a teacher .
it 's a whole week long of excitement .
we were taken care of .
just tell me how to get there . "
this gentleman , he helped me .
i was in a land of plenty .
those things made me angry .
i wanted to do something .
i had to do something .
that made sense . and they agreed .
five months later , that is angeline .
a transformation had begun in her life .
be the first . people will follow you .
the first is bhar@@ ti k@@ her .
he too is reinventing the miniature tradition .
and this is what happened .
we just did not know .
and was sil@@ via ga@@ us right ?
just look at that 17 year-old .
obviously the whole project here is huge .
this is a picture of it .
it 's above and behind your right ear .
and you know what pirates really like ?
i really love cheese sandwiches . "
and so ivan goes to get a drink .
and now , here comes the other pirate .
this pirate is called joshua .
child : so , that one is his .
rs : that 's exactly right .
uh-oh . why did he take that one ?
child : his was on the grass .
child : um , yeah .
and we do have such a tool .
it 's getting them wrong that is living .
rs : i 'm not .
rs : yeah , we worry about this .
this little syringe contains the moral molecule .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it 's called oxytocin .
there must be a reason why . "
but it was test@@ ably stupid .
i think i can do that .
but i 'm also a skeptic .
let me show you how we do that .
so we recruit some people for an experiment .
you only do it one time .
so we have a biology of trustworthiness .
it 's empathy that makes us moral .
now this idea is not new .
so i tend to avoid that .
so i tend to do those things .
i just found the molecule behind it .
" well this is very valuable .
tell that guy to wait half an hour .
now we know what happens .
also , high stress inhibits oxytocin .
it 's all inside of us .
i did n't know a single person .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and guess what ?
she had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
her mother , that 's right .
her mother was number two .
for example , through social media .
so he was using social media in private .
there you go . that 's connection .
and they indeed also release oxytocin .
let me show it to you .
come here . give me a hug .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- there you go .
and this gets me back to my research .
a morning that i will never forget .
do they know where we live ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- my family believes in me .
like me , they are dreaming big .
so let me start in on that problem .
there are 10 million people in the u.s.
here you have a retina .
anyway , you get the idea .
" i feel good . "
" i can feel my cancer grow . "
" i feel pretty . "
that was the first concept here .
we 're very used to this .
it 's baleen . moving on .
this is an 11-year-old student .
his wish was to become a police officer .
he wanted to help poor people .
she wanted to become an independent woman .
a 24@@ -year-old truck driver .
she wanted a change in her life .
an 8@@ 1@@ -year-old itinerant farmer .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- a 3@@ 7-year-old road worker .
and this is what she said .
jh : are you hoping to ?
jh : 40 to 50 ? yeah .
so thank you again , so much .
woman : you 're most welcome .
i 'm 43 years old right now .
and this is why they revolted .
the intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people .
they found something called facebook .
they found something called twitter .
we are going to spread the message .
and then you have yemen .
al-qaeda is taking over our territories .
we do not create revolutions .
let us accept the choice of the people .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you very much .
thank you for coming here .
we have covered many wars .
fifty percent of it is coming from america .
they 've had some speakers there .
i believe they 've heard your talk .
audience : what are you reading ?
they begin with a question .
that 's actually what an experiment is .
the first step was to ask a question .
what was the feedback like ?
and i 'll just read one .
very few things went to the market .
there i learned different things .
brazil radic@@ alized very strongly .
but i did much more than that .
i put photography as my life .
i saw in rwanda total brutality .
i lost my faith in our species .
i started to have infection everywhere .
you must stop . stop .
and i made the decision to stop .
it was a big coincidence .
you say that you were born in paradise .
let 's build the paradise again .
it became a national park .
we must protect the forest in this sense .
but we create an incredible contradiction .
gone very fast , disappeared .
a lack of oxygen in the water .
the trees are the hair of our planet .
there are thousands of trees .
and i 'll show you the last picture .
and there it was , a great revolution .
we did not prioritize right .
what is it , then ?
no one knows what the hell we do .
we see all the same symptoms .
ml : it 's much better than that .
i 'm afraid by what i see .
think about the innovation that went into that .
think about the infrastructure to build it .
consider the 2008 terrorist attack on mumbai .
they were armed with mobile phones .
they had access to satellite imagery .
but perhaps their greatest innovation was this .
they did all of this in real time .
what did they do with this ?
they used it to great effect .
he was not a schoolteacher .
this is the world that we live in .
but they 're adapting quickly .
we 've all seen 3d printers .
the technologies are allowing bigger printers .
this is the future that awaits us .
it 's a great challenge for them .
so how will criminals abuse this ?
that has significant implications for us .
but it goes deeper than that .
how will we protect them in the future ?
but this is not going to work .
then we could all be engaged in helping .
your days become devoted to protecting yourself .
and , i love this story so much .
all of us are refugees .
i do not use them as weapons .
think about the game of chess .
so it 's a very simple algorithm .
and it sounds like an easy problem .
so let 's think about the inference .
you want to generate beliefs about the world .
and i 've put the formula up there .
so let me give you an intuitive example .
and here 's inside the brain .
so i get two sources .
any discre@@ pancy should hopefully be external .
everything left over is external to me .
what evidence is there for this ?
and the game is very simple .
but we 've got a problem .
now this is a bunch of dots moving .
imagine i want to intercept this ball .
here are two possible paths to that ball .
so how does electricity ignite residential fires ?
so what about circuit brea@@ kers ?
it 's a pretty expensive machine .
those machines go the proverbial jun@@ k@@ yard .
and everything began pretty au@@ sp@@ ici@@ ously .
there has to be something better . "
everything else is the same .
this is an incredibly rugged machine .
and finally , it 's affordable .
but we 're not content to stop there .
all the gra@@ ye@@ d-out species disappear .
i can sink my teeth into this . "
because simple answers may emerge .
some companies succeed . others fail .
that is not just poetry .
it 's a very powerful principle .
it does n't take ph.d. ' s .
they also have great capacity .
it is a very difficult battle .
but what do we do first ?
then the city grows around it .
it 's called " all the answers . "
and it 's a made@@ -up word .
and the bus is full of people .
fairly obvious what that is .
the design comes from within .
but there are four x-ray plates .
you can see them overlapping .
there is over 500 separate components .
boeing sent me a 747 in containers .
and i sent them back an x-ray .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i kid you not .
the one on the left is an x-ray .
so , i like to use them .
it makes it more organic , more natural .
but i just like it in bright orange .
yeah , i 'm quite pleased with it .
first of all - any questions so far ?
you wo n't be familiar with it .
it 's a picture by paul kle@@ e .
yeah , that 's great .
it 's more economical and also more efficient .
one , two , three .
that 's a picture by keith haring .
and now they 're all in here .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i just piled them up .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- thank you very much .
it 's been a major trending topic .
and it 's terribly endangered .
there 's more than five million of them .
twitter recently did some research .
they looked at their local population .
and negroponte says this is crazy .
this is the old economy .
it includes things like the internet cables .
it 's getting more connected .
more of problems are global in scale .
more of our economics is global in scale .
alisa 's the president of public radio international .
this is a problem we have to solve .
this is a group called global voices .
they were doing something much simpler .
most independent media was shut down .
and the results can be pretty funny .
they put it online for free .
basically , she 's a dee@@ jay .
he goes by the moni@@ ker white african .
dhani has a television show .
he finds a local sporting team .
my challenge instead is this .
we have to fix our media .
we 've got to make it happen .
technology acceler@@ ates things exponentially .
and then we 've done a third thing .
they 're today 's iraqi jews .
a third migrated to persia .
the bush administration did not even respond .
but this is not an ancient conflict .
this is not even an ideological conflict .
you make it with your enemies . "
what is it that we 're concerned about ?
alright , so i 've got you nervous .
and we have spent a lot of money .
let 's pretend there 's a pandemic .
main result is that there is tremendous confusion .
nobody knows the chain of command .
the rest is up to your local community .
and you 'll have massive competition .
the vaccine will probably be useless .
so here 's where the decisions come in .
you 're the mayor of your local town .
nobody was processing the credit cards .
your insurance payments did n't go through .
overall we lost 700,000 people .
it was likened to the plague .
how many masks do you need ?
i do n't think that 's rational .
but can you sustain your company that way ?
otherwise you 're in trouble .
happy to take your questions .
it 's a very complicated ecology .
but we do not completely understand why .
the mechanism is n't clear .
i 'm thinking dip@@ stick .
but we do n't really know .
but it 's not bacterial pneumonia .
so let 's just run through these guys .
the brain works by association .
and nobody knew anything about it .
and he works this system .
the magazines started to cover it .
and our pc version became quite mature .
so we did n't do it .
and we have to resist to the changes .
we have to keep everything under control .
how do we steer a balloon ?
this can be in politics .
this can be in spirituality .
but sometimes it 's very parado@@ xi@@ cal .
so , we went down actually .
we changed completely our strategy .
we landed with 40 kilos .
i had no idea how it was possible .
well , solar power airplanes are not new .
you need 64 meter wingspan .
cockpit , propeller , engine .
50 kilos for the entire fuselage .
this is the complete structure of the airplane .
a real airplane that we could finally present .
and what 's the goal now ?
a little bit like on this picture here .
this is not an airplane .
i could have told them that .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- that 's reassuring .
it was half as long .
and it is certainly a wonder .
that 's 3.2 billion people .
nobody would want to give them up .
the 20 largest cities in the world .
and the camera is looking down at her .
we 've got to show them this thing .
they learned to start with cell phones .
you do it in your sneakers .
it was a historical day .
too many questions are left unanswered .
space-time underwent a phase transition .
i do n't think so .
this is where it began .
it 's so unpredictable and so fragile .
and this is how we began .
these are just some examples .
that statistic is so sad .
the first c is cognitive training .
what does average i.q. really mean ?
then i underwent cognitive training .
this is not supposed to occur .
and this person is particularly interesting .
i still had migraine headaches .
all consciousness is about communication .
this is it being held in the hand .
it weighs less than a gram .
where does it go inside the body ?
so it goes in and it stays there .
here are the implan@@ tation sites .
and he was walking around .
and it works . it works .
the audience is too small .
he 's a very , very remarkable man .
that should always ring alarm bells .
but that sounds really techie .
that 's a technical term .
but that 's not enough .
so how does this work ?
how can we explain this strange phenomenon ?
so they all cluster together .
this is a drug called reboxetine .
and i 'm a very nerdy doctor .
and this is not an isolated story .
it 's an open-source project .
so this one is a quad@@ cop@@ ter .
it 's a small model helicopter .
so this is the t@@ x@@ t@@ bomber .
he has 2@@ 80,000 followers .
this is a ph probe .
not me . i 'm an old guy .
they got 10 million dollars .
this is happening to us today .
we have three main groups .
this is alfred gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
this is bjor@@ n sund@@ in .
and his answer was yes .
what do you do with certificates ?
the company headquarters are right here .
they will tap your internet connection .
because i have nothing to hide . "
privacy is not up for discussion .
same was true for china .
how to make it ? it 's simple .
you have twitter , we have weibo .
that 's not only to censor you .
and now the result is very simple .
we all know mubarak is technically dead .
so it an@@ gered the chinese netizens .
it has its own innovation .
so they send them back in recent years .
why ? because they have the data .
they have everything in their hands .
so the crack@@ down is very serious .
the server is in beijing .
it 's never happened before .
something will happen behind it .
so , what 's the future ?
after all , we are the mouse .
so my conclusion is very simple .
mushrooms are very fast in their growth .
we share in common the same pathogens .
it knows that you are there .
this is a photograph by franz hu@@ eber .
it was called proto@@ tax@@ ites .
all across most land masses .
we were involved with several experiments .
the mycelium absorbs the oil .
and i 'll show you a graph here .
as a treatment against consumption .
this is extremely rare fungus .
our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants .
they gave it to the queen .
it covers over 200,000 species .
but watch what happens here .
and we came up with econ@@ ol .
well , now is that time .
it 's one of my favorite bathing suits .
and i 'm living proof .
no blue , no green .
that 's where all the assets are !
and with knowing comes caring .
but first we have to know .
what about the water ? "
we can now go to the arctic .
that 's bad news for us too .
also it 's bad news for us .
the highest concentrations are in red .
but , there is good news .
there are still some blue whales .
imagine the ocean without fish .
and you can find them on google earth .
this was in the late ' 80s .
they would n't have me .
here 's me singing " sleep . "
-lrb- singing -rrb- stephen hans@@ on from sweden .
here 's our winner of the soprano solo .
and scott aggregated all of the videos .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you . thank you .
and the video went viral .
-lrb- singing -rrb- and some younger members .
and there were 900 people involved in that .
it does n't matter the technology .
it was n't a virtual choir .
this will be a premiere today .
but we do have the first three minutes .
and it was his favorite artwork ever .
he painted a beautiful vermeer .
that 's not so surprising .
this was recorded in 1931 .
so one answer was george clooney .
that causes a huge drop in the value .
this is a work by jackson pollock .
who here likes the work of jackson pollock ?
they just do n't like it .
and here 's a brief clip of this .
so she 's struck with pity .
the first shock is recorded as very painful .
the first shock hurts like hell .
the emergency generators did not start .
the first time it was a c-section .
their decisions , their actions matter .
we 've heard a lot about that .
and we need to train them right .
i learned something about courage .
it was a breath of fresh air .
they wanted us to think critically .
they wanted us to be analytical .
and i was part of that .
and those leaders did not emerge spontaneously .
and ghana was not paying enough attention .
so this is what i 'm doing now .
i think it would make a huge difference .
it 's such a simple statement .
can we create a perfect society ?
am i out of time ? ok .
it says a lot about her .
she won with 75 percent of the vote .
and it gives me a lot of hope .
it 's an incredible opportunity .
thank you , and god bless .
but they 'd heard some frightening rumors .
they have the same architecture .
what would happen to our minds ?
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios .
i 'll begin in 18@@ 24 .
the treaties were out the window .
i want to repeat that part .
the lakota defeat the u.s. army .
he was later killed while in custody .
that cla@@ use was obviously ignored .
18@@ 87 : the daw@@ es act .
tribes lost millions of acres .
they were tired of treaties .
they were tired of sacred hills .
they were tired of ghost dances .
so they brought out their can@@ n@@ ons .
this is the legacy of manifest destiny .
there must be some call to action .
so where does that leave us ?
shru@@ gging our shoulders in the dark ?
it grows and is nurtured .
there are different types of waste .
this is the restaurant , ac@@ orn house .
floor : sustainable , recyclable .
chairs : recycled and recyclable .
i hate waste , especially walls .
and that 's a plastic polymer .
will they outlive me ? they probably might .
and we filter our own water .
here 's a great little example .
it serves 220 people a day .
we generate quite a lot of waste .
this is the waste room .
you ca n't get rid of waste .
i compost it in this garden .
so , water is a very important aspect .
i managed to do it .
but this is an electrical restaurant .
this is basically air-@@ handling .
i 've got metal and earth to come .
okay . so this is my next project .
that 's zero food waste .
i think it 's important .
what does this compassion entail ?
i call that unity god .
the cleaner came into the synagogue .
ah , what a wonderful smell . "
takes the bread and goes home .
next week , with raisins . "
this went on for years .
and this seemed very interesting to me .
and that has n't changed at all .
and the interview was 40 pages long .
so existence is temporarily suspended .
and it happens in different realms .
but it happens in other activities .
it 's not very challenging any more .
let 's talk about past and future billions .
and this chart goes back to 1500 .
this was n't just an economic story .
this is not a new question .
that 's a great question .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- you bet .
that is so right and so cool .
let 's call them the killer apps .
it 's the same with institutions .
two , the scientific revolution .
five , the consumer society .
and six , the work ethic .
think of what that means .
that really was a killer application .
you just have to feed me . "
hardly anyone in south america did .
that 's another killer app .
the empires were n't all bad .
finally , the work ethic .
who 's got the work ethic now ?
and could africa get that sequencing wrong ?
warning : that may not work .
i think that 's its real importance .
i have two loa@@ ves of bread here .
who pre@@ fers the whole-@@ meal bread ?
it was a mythical past .
of course , the reality is quite different .
and it actually drove up our yields .
that is the reality of our modern life .
but it has changed the world .
what happened to our bread in the meantime ?
we added in more sugar .
let 's go back to traditional farming .
but this is a fallacy .
so we must find other solutions .
so what can we do ?
can we find a solution to produce more ?
so what can we do ?
but yes there are some solutions .
that 's where we should move .
but we can do a lot more .
talk to people in restaurants .
take some of my bread .
we 've never had that before .
eat it , and feel privileged .
i 've never seen anything like this .
and by and large , this has failed .
so the question is , why is that ?
and that is the real network effect .
but one time it broke down .
they show an interesting thing .
so obviously this was a gadget to have .
and that leads to specialization .
so we could do that for telephones .
and they had these branches .
and it 's a business for her .
this is what some people think .
poor people are a resource .
their involvement reduces the cost .
i 've been very surprised .
it 's just an experiment .
now , why does this happen ?
now , what 's really going on ?
i talked about that earlier .
which you can completely ignore .
your heart starts beating faster .
this ca n't be my mother .
there 's no delusion through the phone .
the patient 's not delusional .
it sounds like an oxy@@ moron .
and this is a serious clinical problem .
now , how do you help these patients ?
but that costs millions of dollars .
it was a paralyzed phantom arm .
" and move your normal hand . "
" ok , open your eyes . "
i said , " what ? "
now , why does this happen ?
so , that 's the bonus .
he was a cousin of charles darwin .
in us , all the senses are distinct .
these people mu@@ ddle up their senses .
i 'm going to answer that question .
it 's never been answered before .
well , there are many theories .
now remember - why does this happen ?
so far , so good .
instantly , you 've found the links .
here , you 've got martian alphabet .
well , it 's one or two mutants .
so , they completely miss the metaphorical meaning .
-lrb- applause -rrb- sorry about that .
africa 's beg@@ g@@ ing-@@ bowl leaks .
it 's taken out of africa .
that 's what the world bank says .
look at africa 's beg@@ g@@ ing-@@ bowl .
yes , put that aside .
let 's take food imports .
we know that something has gone fundamentally wrong .
i asked them to name me just 20 .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i let that pass .
government is the problem in africa .
where do they get their money ?
it 's the seat of government .
first one is the political system .
it 's owned by extended families .
the accent is on the " i. "
they decide what to do .
could you please show that ?
yes , it 's an enterprise .
there is also traditional medicine .
i look at even my family .
but kids could be entrepreneurs as well .
attention deficit disorder , bipolar disorder .
i could go on and on .
so i just figured that out earlier .
i was groomed as an entrepreneur .
and so i 'll just go get them .
and he said , " i know . "
i learned that at a young age .
so that 's obvious , right .
he could just deliver them .
and i thought that was kind of cool .
and you 'd make these chairs .
and you could stuff pins in them .
you just pick them up with both feet .
you ca n't do it on stage .
i packaged them up three ways .
those sold for two dollars each .
but it paid the bills .
and i think i was 14 .
supply , demand , big opportunity .
they go around looking for what it is .
shit , you 've missed 25 years .
my kids do that all the time .
show them the grumpy employees .
my kids love this stuff .
look for that kind of stuff .
because there 's huge opportunities in that .
i thought maybe i 'd pronounced it wrong .
it 's a fucking or@@ gy ! "
and you can just imagine them .
that was an interesting case .
it was n't just your standard installation .
it could have been a train wreck .
they know what they 're looking for .
they feel that the institution is elitist .
you know it 's an or@@ gy .
and so his team stepped aside .
they were part of the bad guys .
finally , the sin@@ alo@@ a federation .
and it 's the process of learning things .
i 'm going to build towards complexity now .
juggling three balls is simple and normal .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- excuse me .
and then you get crazy .
and you could play with the rhythm .
make it faster and smaller .
ok . it 's done . thanks .
now , let 's actually learn something .
what you 're going to learn is this .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- ok ? here we go .
-lrb- rattling -rrb- so , a moment .
-lrb- rattling -rrb- another moment .
time . how can you look at time ?
so , there 's a rhythm to it .
and to change , and to change .
where do we like to kiss people ?
but let 's not forget the hair .
there 's a definite difference .
max has kindly donated his photograph to me .
after surgery , everything norm@@ alizes .
we crave the approval of our peers .
it 's a cri@@ ppling time .
she was n't miserable at all .
i learned a huge amount from henry .
and that 's what these people can do .
hen@@ ri@@ api illustrates this phenomenon as well .
it was my longest operation .
he continued to work as a psychiatric nurse .
we can categorize it like that .
they do n't feel different .
their identity does n't change .
we 'd be pretty uncomfortable .
but that 's not good enough .
we then bent a plate up to it .
that 's the good news .
but we 've still got problems .
we 've got mouth cancer to solve .
we still ca n't get rid of scars .
we need to do research .
the wall was covered with ...
richard saul wurman : really ?
but i could n't do anything else .
i think it was circum@@ stan@@ tial .
and a few people got excited about it .
he 's building this huge concrete place .
so where do we go now ?
back to - everything 's so temporary .
fg : i do n't really know .
rsw : why did you want that ?
rsw : no . what did he say ?
it 's a richer experience .
or is it going to be down near ...
it 's not his money , of course .
fg : i do n't know .
what 's the schedule , richard ?
you 're not going to defy gravity .
i met them in bilbao .
they came for three days .
rsw : this is the computer building ?
fg : yeah , the computer building .
fg : ask mi@@ ri@@ am !
rsw : did n't get a laugh .
what do you bring to it ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- rsw : did it leak ?
so four of us went .
fg : so , i got up .
we stood up , we walked out .
i said , " nope . "
and we get a lot of that .
but let me just say a couple words .
and i looked like this .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- you can guess this .
and those fantasies , or french or italian .
this is the thing about post@@ modernism .
in 1997 , this building opened .
because architecture actually moves quite quickly .
it 's a vacation community .
let 's be a part of this .
fantastic tales , anecdotes from speakers .
i actually want answers from you .
we 've all heard these things .
it all began with a fantastic phone call .
a satellite picture looking down at the earth .
i call it my z.@@ e.@@ n. cluster .
each country has a unique value proposition .
because it is actually a long-term play .
it 's an important strategic partner .
let 's put nigeria in perspective .
and emeka and i have had these discussions .
what else is going on there ? egypt .
what 's going on there ?
135 million-@@ plus people . think about that .
the same for telecoms across the country .
because there are amazing opportunities available .
that 's about a 50th of a millimeter .
this is amazing , i think .
this one i particularly like .
the understanding is very low .
but we have a problem .
here 's the overall picture .
but we 're spending 36 percent .
well what are we taking in ?
now how did we get here ?
how could you have a problem like this ?
well , some really nice little tricks .
it 's riddled with gim@@ mic@@ ks . "
this is so blat@@ ant , so extreme .
they sell off the assets .
well what 's going to give ?
technology has a role to play .
it 's the gold standard .
we just shot you . "
so we need these pieces .
it 's a james joy@@ ce quote .
it 's significant to us .
we need some alternatives for oil .
we 're going to have a personal universe .
well , our gaze fills the universe .
i 've also lived in biosphere 2 .
it was essentially an organic farm .
we were growing plants like crazy .
we had lost seven tons of oxygen .
yes . in a sense it was terrifying .
not me , that was for sure .
and we did indeed find it .
and we found it in the concrete .
i had been growing all my own food .
people must have thought i was nuts .
this is what i saw .
but this is also what i saw .
and it will produce a food crop .
and put your project in that context .
it 's such a huge subject . "
it 's a certain type of aesthetic .
we 're very uncomfortable with unti@@ diness .
and i threw away my rake .
and i have an oasis .
the yo@@ gis had it right .
it also connects us in time .
the dinosaurs had a really bad day .
it came in on a friday night .
this did a huge amount of damage .
they 're just not big enough .
this is a potential threat .
well , what do we do about them ?
we have to find these things first .
nasa has devoted money to this .
comets are very much like asteroids .
that means we can do it again .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- but we 'd be rich !
this was a mother 's day gift .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- particularly creepy .
this is project called ray .
and this is what came to me .
all right . stay strong . peace .
ze frank : so - yeah .
one stood out in particular .
that song - -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
in two weeks , they found him .
it 's been an interesting two weeks . "
sometimes they 're a little bit more abstract .
recording : okay , here 's something .
but sometimes i feel really lonely .
you can look at it online .
together , for our future . "
so one of them was fairly straightforward .
and this was " scared . "
and i do n't have much time .
and i shut that part down .
that 's when i got scared .
run for your heterosexual lives , people .
it goes and goes and engul@@ fs !
what are these gays up to ?
what do they want ? "
-lrb- applause -rrb- there it is !
the u.s. constitution is the gay agenda .
but there it is . the gay agenda .
run for your heterosexual lives .
i 'm looking at you , north carolina .
he has a 4.@@ 0 .
he pra@@ ys before he eats .
it does n't require any special training .
unfortunately , it happens all the time .
i am not a lu@@ dd@@ ite .
this is sir arthur conan doyle .
the woman says , " good morning . "
she says , " it was good . "
she says , " i did . "
and she says , " i am . "
he made no attempt at diagnosis .
i call it the i@@ patient .
the focus was around the patient .
this is when i was in texas .
but to her , it mattered deeply .
i was very influenced by that anecdote .
there was just no way .
and i began my ritual .
they 're all about transformation .
i would feel the abdomen .
it was an offering , an invitation .
i will see you through this .
i will never abandon you .
the mystery persisted for about 20 years .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- this was the first one .
it was like , 160 dollars for this ?
i almost could n't finish it .
i was really happy when i was done .
it 's in the smell .
10 seconds passed and it was gone .
it has 3@@ 60-@@ degree views .
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel .
it tasted fine . it tasted interesting .
there 's one with a fragrance dispen@@ ser .
the seat is pre@@ heated .
there 's a water jet that cleans you .
there 's an air jet that dries you .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- this was a fun one .
it was such a smooth ride .
but it 's 60 years old .
there 's not much of it left .
and i was n't that impressed .
and it was n't just to that wine .
make yourself understood to the computer . "
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and i left .
this is a 15 year-old boy .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and indeed they had .
i called in 26 children .
and then that 's her over there .
remember , they do n't study english .
but 30 percent is not a pass .
i made them into groups of four .
" you can exchange groups .
the worst , in 45 .
i 'll come back after two months .
the granny cloud sits over there .
you ca n't catch me .
teacher : well done . very good ...
two children watch a tedtalk .
they wanted to be football@@ ers before .
this is a sole in newcastle .
i went to turin in may .
i tried a really hard one then .
it 's pit@@ agora . "
this sent shi@@ vers up my spine .
i 'm going to start with glenn gould .
-lrb- music -rrb- how about that ?
and then you heard the original .
that 's where i 'm at .
it 's now coming in this world .
but yet , it was human .
and fortunately , it 's right in here .
seriously , but dangerously fun .
and something very unusual happens .
and they begin an incredible ballet .
charles whitman was his name .
and you can trust it .
and therefore , the most playful .
and so he followed up on it .
this is our maiden voyage in this .
there 's no other cause .
where had that water gone ?
carbon goes back to the atmosphere .
well , i have news for you .
and it got worse , not better .
one good thing did come out of it .
we have never understood it .
you have changed the micro@@ climate .
why has it accelerated lately ?
we had no understanding of that .
this picture is a typical seasonal grassland .
you can drill into a particular year .
and i see greg le@@ mond now .
we talk about drowning in data .
so with that , i thank you .
and this is my profile .
now let me stop here .
the red dots have exploded .
the gray dots have grown exponentially .
today we 've launched collusion .
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
he showed it to ja@@ vier .
that 's more than 250 hundred-@@ thousand acres .
we went and looked at a site .
this picture 's from there .
they even can bring with them some financing .
and i like that kind of response .
that 's just what we were going for .
you can watch them any time you want .
sebastian and i have forgotten some of that .
they got this statement of accomplishment .
so what have we learned ?
sebastian 's teaching another class now .
i 'll do one in the fall .
it 's a really exciting time .
-lrb- applause -rrb- " the better man . "
who was the better man ?
who was the better man ?
who was the better man ?
let me try and describe her to you .
" never go back . "
never acknowledge the ghost on the stair .
ladies , do n't do it .
tell them to go to hell .
you bodies are wonderful as they are .
nothing good can come of this .
time rules all , my dearest .
none can make a stitch in time .
nor may time be bought or sold .
dearest , do i love thee less ?
i hope you know that now .
let me put this blun@@ tly .
" hail to the gods of america . "
hail to the gods of america !
hail to the gods of the dream .
inv@@ ic@@ tus e pluri@@ bus un@@ um .
which is america 's jupiter ?
they eye of a dollar bill ?
or is it celebrity status ?
the worship of those we hate .
what of the titans of media ?
or hollywood 's siren call ?
what of the up@@ start sport ?
ay@@ e , that it does .
" love came to visit me . "
at 30 my powers seemed mighty to me .
okay , i was ill .
that was in october of 2000 .
i 'm not an evil man .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- not with much success .
we killed every single one of them .
inch by inch we killed them .
and i am as bad as you .
and you stay up for 12 .
twenty-@@ two god@@ children i 've got .
if you 're a woman , remember that .
a generous mistress whom many loved much .
you all know this story .
he was talking about the space aliens .
i have never built an atomic pile .
and that 's when it happened .
" there 's no such thing . "
the street was entirely empty .
she was very tall , i would say .
i did not even turn my head .
make of that what you will .
and did i want to come with ?
now , i did not speak portuguese .
this is the environmental conditions on the planet .
but is it happening anywhere ?
so crisis leading into opportunities .
now , what about the future ?
and we need a transformation .
and what shall we do ?
you get people out of poverty .
and then back@@ track innovations within that .
so , there is scientific evidence .
do you feel like you are all alone ?
-lrb- music -rrb- -lrb- applause -rrb- thank you .
it 's such an honor for me .
but it 's now your turn .
those are conve@@ yor belts that go around .
and this is the big difference .
and this will become the standard ethiopian keyboard .
the camel smells were unbelievable .
launched it on the 12 of november .
i want you do something else .
differ@@ encing is another technique we use .
but that 's not all .
we 're becoming de@@ sensi@@ tized .
conscious listening always creates understanding .
-lrb- audience : yes . -rrb- good .
the first one is silence .
second , i call this the mix@@ er .
how many birds am i hearing ?
where are they ? where are those ripples ?
or just try this one on for size .
-lrb- coffee grin@@ der -rrb- wow !
i call that the hidden choir .
it 's around us all the time .
this is playing with those filters .
and finally , an acronym .
thank you for listening to me today .
the results were quite extraordinary .
it literally flat@@ -l@@ ined .
but experts do get things wrong .
but how can we do this ?
this does n't mean having to get a ph.d.
what has your investigation focused on ?
and what has it ignored ?
but we need to go even further .
it 's sort of cloudy water .
that makes me worry a little bit .
and this ethical problem 's a big problem .
here 's a girl who 's almost dead .
they evolved to produce less toxin .
it would n't be causing severe disease .
and the idea is very simple .
so , you get this vicious cycle .
the goal is to turn this around .
antibiotic sensitivity was going down .
this is a long-term solution .
it is the g8 summit .
africa has received many opportunities .
governments are not changing it . why ?
they talk to international donors .
where has all the aid gone ?
the expected foreign aid : 1.@@ 9 trillion .
hand-to-@@ mouth is 2.@@ 6 trillion .
the military , 380 billion .
trade and industry takes 43 billion .
three hundred thirty-@@ three members of parliament .
i hope i have achieved that .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- thank you very much .
and i 've done this in three parts .
and here 's a little image of that .
and this was an amazing year .
it was really a fascinating journey .
so it had its downsides .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- not really .
i got both of them .
so there was the top@@ i@@ ary there .
and i have to say , thank god .
i had to put on sunscreen .
there was the washing of hands .
i had to do that properly .
so that took a lot of time .
and it was successful overall .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- without the sex part .
and i finally have stabilized .
and it was done in europe .
it really imp@@ airs cognition .
and our founding fathers knew about this .
that 's my greatest hope .
that 's what enzymes are doing .
they become accessible to the yeast as food .
everything in its place . first stage .
we have to develop the gluten .
that 's called " rounding . "
we call it " proofing . "
three transformations take place in the oven .
they give us that beautiful brown crust .
there 's a little car@@ ry-@@ over baking .
we can plant those in the ground .
so we turn it into flour .
i 'd call that radical .
so , we 've got now this flour .
in stage one , we weigh it .
enzymes are breaking forth sugars .
it 's used as a symbol for transformation .
bash@@ o was a brilliant man .
i hope it will be .
they define what the system is .
the second one is internal energy .
that 's the planet that we live on .
and these have all co-@@ evolved .
what do i mean by that ?
they interact with one another constantly .
all of them interact with one another .
look at this complexity here .
and there 's an urgency to this .
this is very , very exciting .
we know little or nothing about it .
the computational power is amazing .
and that 's what we really need .
it 's a new world .
it was once called neptune .
and this is what the planet looks like .
this is what it looks like .
and this is just the first of these .
there is a number of robotic systems .
it 's a full spectrum of tools .
this is what it actually looks like .
so what can we actually do tomorrow ?
nanotechnology : this is a small generator .
and this is the magic one .
and that 's transmitted back to land immediately .
he was a very religious man .
he was a mathematician on a mission .
your body is covered with fractals .
so nature has this self-@@ similar structure .
this is a village in southern zambia .
you have a huge ring .
i came up with this structure here .
once again , infinity is important .
and three times , the answer is no .
it 's a shared technology in africa .
it 's not really mathematical knowledge .
you learn the next level of knowledge .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
and his answer was very interesting .
and they would n't tell me .
so even plus odd gives you odd .
odd plus even gives you odd .
anybody in the world can use them .
we 've started a pilot program in ghana .
we 've also been working in design .
it 's in ecological sustainability .
it 's also in some bad things .
i was 19 years old at the time .
we know almost nothing about it .
the nitrogen has two problems .
it makes you lo@@ opy .
but , the theory 's relatively easy .
the tricky part is the implementation .
there had to be a better way .
how is it that they do that ?
you also have three microprocessors .
there 's a just-@@ unbelievable diversity .
it 's not just fish , either .
and we 're not quite sure why .
video : look at those ...
diver 2 : uh , silver@@ tip sharks .
and i 'm not making that stuff up .
but , it 's much more than that .
that 's half-a-@@ million dollars per pound .
we were at 360 feet .
now , this one 's pretty cool .
he had made a very simple mistake .
you have to balance those two goals .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it was great .
it 's been an incredible few days .
i 've been in the audience .
it comes from popular culture .
nigeria got its independence in 1960 .
let me tell you a nigerian joke .
and dick and harry repeat this .
a lot of us are very privileged .
all of those are gone .
african narratives in the west , they proliferate .
i really do n't care anymore .
have i not myself been imprisoned ?
have i not myself been beaten ? "
but this is a good thing .
it 's never going to be easy .
" here , " jimmy said .
pressure can make everything whole again .
music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone .
we had a little natural experiment .
so the first way that we did this .
they said , " yes . "
what did they spend it on ?
huge effect here of starbucks .
here 's a guy from canada .
" i took my girlfriend out for dinner .
but then we see extraordinary differences .
this is a woman from canada .
perfectly nice thing to do .
compare that to this woman from uganda .
but enormously different motivations here .
these are only two countries .
so these are sales teams in belgium .
you do n't get any money from that .
it 's an extraordinary thing .
and i come from a long way .
i saw my village burned down .
my brothers and sisters were scattered .
i wanted to revenge for my village .
so that pain has gone out .
but my story is huge .
i talk about my story .
and only 16 people survived that journey .
my dreams are like tor@@ ment .
sometimes you gotta lose to win .
never give up . never give in .
slept with one eye open wide .
i carry the banner of the trauma .
it 's like i 'm living a dream .
ah ! the children of darfur .
i was ready to eat .
i hated the people in the north .
but i had this question .
i 've been in a painful journey .
i do n't eat breakfast . no lunch .
the people are giving three dollars .
i do n't know how they did it .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- but that moved me .
as a nation we have been crippled .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
-lrb- applause -rrb- invest in education .
and now we have a couple in university .
and she rescued over 150 child soldiers .
are you guys ready to celebrate emma ?
emmanuel jal : all right .
yeah ! i 'm gonna get crazy now .
and i was one of those people .
she was my childhood friend .
now , i found the answer very quickly .
they were constantly short of cash .
they were constantly searching for cash .
i 'll give you an idea .
because they had no idea .
it was a psychiatrist . he loved sailing .
and there are three main stages .
so what is rogue economics ?
it has happened before in history .
it has happened with industrial revolution .
it is trillions , it 's not billions .
no other country can do that .
and this is what people did .
it was introduced only in the united states .
we are for decorative purposes only .
now , something else happened .
but it has to be done together .
all they needed was labor .
i 'll go through the three basic configurations .
this is the flat floor configuration .
the first configuration is easy to understand .
and there it is in the thrust configuration .
effectively you would have something like this .
that 's an enormous benefit .
here it is in a flat floor configuration .
here it is in an end stage configuration .
here it is in a thrust configuration .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i promise .
so this one was taken around five .
no , no . the other way .
we 're doing two different things here .
one of them is to take that real ...
the other soldier also came .
the other one carried evelyn aside .
you can say a person is lying .
help witness give cameras to the world .
we did n't even have a telephone .
there are only 200 of these bears left .
they 're more rare than the panda bear .
i thought , my career 's over .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
and what does that mean ?
polar bears are amazing hunters .
they 're not going to die of hypothermia .
they 're going to get to land .
and here 's a picture of sick ice .
here 's me in my office .
i hope you appreciate yours .
so we had this little communication breakdown .
this is a bo@@ wh@@ ead whale .
alright , my favorite part .
and so people love to form their opinions .
it does n't work that way .
they 're not these little harbor seals .
and they 're also curiously aggressive .
i 'm with my swedish assistant and guide .
and now you 've got to deliver .
and you ca n't publish excuses . "
and so that did n't work .
this went on for four days .
i get emotional . sorry .
and i 'm so passionate about it .
stick with the people you know .
stick with people like you . "
what can i learn with you ?
the economies of the future depend on that .
people are n't close or distant .
we have to change the norms .
the range of digital relations is extraordinary .
me only existed in the trying .
my body was often in the way .
me was a floating head .
it was a way of lo@@ cating myself .
i did this in front of many strangers .
it was an ecstatic experience .
some women became quiet and disappeared .
then i went somewhere else .
all the stories began to bleed together .
it was finally being in my body .
it was a million prayers .
it was all these things .
it was all these things .
and that moved us to the next level .
and we 've seen many seminal moments .
there is a historical archive .
dna is a very elegant molecule .
it 's long and it 's complicated .
we are starting to understand that .
it was done by dr. craig venter .
what does a genome look like ?
well , guess what . it does .
and this is extremely profound .
so , then what do you do ?
but there 's an ecosystem here .
we can start to figure that out .
there are thousands of microbes there .
there also is a set of rules .
if we could , would we ?
that 's called a profit .
and after that comes india .
so that 's a very handsome return .
the golf was total@@ ed .
they snap together like a kid 's toy .
the plant also gets smaller .
so we have lots of options .
ours is on the demand side .
and they got very upset .
the agony as an act of passion . "
you make yourself the active voice .
and the object is the passive no-@@ voice .
i used to actually hang up on them .
and it was like being psycho@@ analyzed .
trickster is a change agent .
but i like to cross boundaries .
he was a very selfish meme .
that 's an actual quality of the trickster .
and this is instead of contradiction .
i had no joke for that .
you know we 're being penetrated .
i still have a way to go .
he has to have poise .
it 's an actual thing .
he 's always on the road .
and thank you for inviting me into it .
why have n't we fixed this ?
why have n't we allowed innovation to happen ?
what kind of business model is that ?
who created that business model ? right ?
and it went on for decades .
it was n't about the customers .
they all operate the same way . right ?
i am never using that , right ? "
yet not in education . why ?
they will say the worst things about you .
i thought i knew something .
you plant them in the spring .
why did we ever do it ?
it was a perfect place to have schools .
here 's what we know .
and their kids have an advantage .
but we know this is critical .
now , you take pre-@@ kindergarten .
poor kids need that experience .
i used to make stuff up . right ?
because i actually like kids .
but here 's the problem with testing .
maybe july , maybe june .
and the results have great data .
and so , what do you do ?
you do n't look at it .
i need that data in september .
i need that data in november .
i need to know that this week .
i can predict school scores .
you take me to any school .
and i will be right every single time .
some of it 's not going to work .
we have run out of time .
what did we spend in afghanistan this year ?
thank you all very much . thank you .
and you 're not coming back here . "
so this is the motor .
these are from remote control airplanes .
could we have fuel without fear ?
those fossil fuels have built our civilization .
they 've created our wealth .
so we need a new fire .
but they 're really quite distinct .
their uses are quite concentrated .
let me say that again .
america could lead this next automotive revolution .
the trucks could even use natural gas .
but no vehicles will need oil .
we want our stuff to work too .
it 's fallen by half .
we had to get rid of the smell .
so it was this incredibly terrifying event .
just an extraordinary , terrifying scene .
this is the ministry of justice .
and they re@@ did that building .
everything was at my feet .
i could do nothing wrong .
mother went into a coma .
" dig wells for five years ?
i said , " no . "
i said , " no . "
" what are you doing here ?
you have to work with your hands .
a water divin@@ er is a professional .
a traditional mid@@ wife is a professional .
a traditional bone se@@ tter is a professional .
battered , bruised , you start again .
150 people lived there , worked there .
i was in a bit of a spot .
this is what it looks like today .
but it actually does n't leak .
all the power comes from the sun .
very little water is wasted .
and what do we teach in these schools ?
but all the schools are solar@@ -lit .
every five years we have an election .
he solves my problems in the village .
so i took the husbands along .
you do n't choose the written word .
you do n't choose the spoken word .
this woman is an extraordinary grandmother .
and they have n't collapsed .
but their body language is great .
went straight to the president .
" what 's the story . "
that was his biggest fear .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- success story .
they 're all over the world .
this is africa . it 's hot .
and look at what the beetle does .
and see what his response is .
and you see him do it again .
watch how often the beetle dances .
so here 's our c@@ unning experimenter .
it has n't a clue .
the entire accident is caught on camera .
i would have stopped to help . "
you felt the empathy for that child .
toby himself does better than that .
his name is matt wei@@ ger .
i do n't really believe it is .
it 's been something fulfilling to me .
why was he recovering from surgery ?
i am not a farmer .
and it starts with three people .
this is my harvest , people .
that 's the beauty of this economy .
okay ? we 're feeding seniors .
and that 's just great .
so thank you all and i love them .
the greenest class in new york city .
so we started giving back .
we 're 3,000 strong right now .
and what does it really do ?
this is what we 're doing .
let me tell you something , people .
this is a beautiful moment .
but , understand this is my intellectual viagra .
so help us go from this to this .
it 's simple . share your passion .
this has got to go tomorrow .
people , you can all do that .
but most importantly , just love them .
nothing works like unconditional love .
i urge you to do something .
we can do something here .
i had a sleeping bag .
and then , my translator left .
her mother was still alive .
they slept on the floor at night .
hyun-sook was 11 years old .
this is on the way to school .
this is on the way home .
why is everyone crying ? "
and she refused any help at all .
so anyway , i left .
but i was off on assignment .
did i know anything about this ?
i was very worried about her .
and we ca n't talk to her .
i remember just being so frightened and terrified .
eleven people ended up dying in the fire .
people were lying on the floor .
this guy 's 60 years old .
so , these are the greenhouse tents .
her great aunt at the airport .
it was like the ultimate per@@ k .
she never liked it very much .
she learned english in three months .
this is her cooking teacher .
she 's being bap@@ tized .
used to do their christmas card every year .
this is her half-@@ sister .
this is natasha 's wedding day .
gene is looking a little older .
and we came to a startling conclusion .
this is very , very low .
they have digitized millions of books .
that 's very practical and extremely awesome .
we 're going to try science . "
what do they tell us ?
well the individual n-@@ grams measure cultural trends .
what should i do ? "
here 's a simple way to do it .
it 's kind of like genomics .
cul@@ turo@@ mics is similar .
why can everyone do it ?
there 's various types of frustration .
they grow 10 meters long .
they might weigh up to two tons .
some say up to five tons .
so they were incredibly important animals .
and sharks used to come into the bay .
and that 's a lovely , evocative name .
they 're not protected in ireland .
we know very little about them .
we tagged 105 sharks last summer .
i 'll show you what they look like .
they all basically seem the same .
8,000 animals in the world .
so that was n't going to work .
so i scraped it off .
and they sat on it for months actually .
and so he was all very excited .
and you rarely see them .
look at that lovely , black shark slime .
i 'll take that as my scientific legacy .
and keep an eye out for sharks .
so thank you and thank you for listening .
let me talk about my own experience .
now , these suppliers were our big companies .
many of them did n't want to bribe .
this is what these other cultures demand .
i see my time is ticking .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and so that got me very excited .
this is really cool . "
we went back to the titanic wreck .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
it was really , really quite profound .
you think they ca n't possibly exist .
and it really changed the dynamic .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it 's really cool .
that 's david letter@@ man .
you can see how old this stuff is .
that 's my youngest cousin .
my career basically peaked here .
you see the keyboard strapped to my wrist .
way ahead of my time here .
all right , there 's that robot again .
and that 's my little workshop .
and there 's furby on the half shell .
so she comes to the rescue .
and she does drawings , right ?
there 's my favorite , demon furby .
and so dave and i got working .
we snuck in on the weekend .
and then i started another company .
very , very obse@@ ssive .
there 's some solid works versions of it .
they had to fit within the envelope .
now you start doing the sculpture for this .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- there you go .
they do change over time .
this is john over here .
and these are horrible images .
there was no agricultural productivity left .
this was like a biological desert .
we have 30 species of reptiles .
but we saw the same thing .
there are no trees left .
you also know how much labor is needed .
so beautiful . what a theory .
but is it really that easy ?
so how to break that cycle ?
fire is the biggest problem .
and this forest is quite different .
and they become like nutrient pumps .
and all these species and income .
i 'll just run them very quickly through .
so you can actually change the climate .
we have our farmer schools .
this is how it looks .
all the seeds get eaten .
they have enough income for three families .
this species lives only in the congo .
and it 's used for communication .
they had no stone tools .
he does n't stand quite as upright .
but there are a lot of similarities .
and now we see all four .
none of them are tricks .
we need more sticks , too .
that 's a wasps ' nest .
i hope i have a lighter .
these are happy vocali@@ zations .
video : you 're happy .
you 're very happy about this part .
it means " star " in swahili .
he can now cut through tough animal hide .
it 's a geometric language .
soon she began to write as well .
this time panbanisha is playing the electric piano .
take the cher@@ ries too .
we 're learning how to become like them .
and they 're learning to become like us .
that technology is simulating humans .
we already saw that briefly yesterday .
they are a graphical visualization of a character .
it 's called the central pattern generator .
so that was the idea behind this .
that was the real breakthrough for us .
okay . that 's the video . thanks .
so we started the company .
nothing really interesting , basically .
it 's going to stick out its hands .
so that 's what you see here .
and then , finally hits the floor .
and you see it falls differently .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and this is what happens .
this is all happening automatically in the simulation .
this is another behavior they requested .
and it looks organic . it looks realistic .
you feel kind of sorry for the guy .
the second thing is video games .
he just started to create that dance himself .
if they disappear , so do we .
i go , " why ? "
everything in the universe wears out . "
here are some images from the film .
we buy it for our kids .
this is a mine in zimbabwe right now .
now , that 's not a new story .
it 's a pharmaceutical product .
we need a different machine .
fortunately , we have some examples .
companies did n't feel it was their responsibility .
they do n't own those facilities .
they do n't employ those workers .
they 're not legally liable .
now , getting there is not easy .
you need a safe space .
multinationals are protecting human rights .
well , we do n't .
transparency is absolutely critical to this .
that 's the way the system works .
that 's what we 're trying to provide .
there are thousands of suppliers in there . "
we have 4,000 companies who are members .
they did n't say money .
so i appeal to you .
12 people have stood on the moon .
it all started back in 2001 .
this was like my polar apprenti@@ ce@@ ship .
i 'd spoken to all the experts .
we had decidedly low-tech communications .
there 's a wire dangling down either side .
ultimately , we ran out of time .
we 've got to pick you up . "
the first one was reaching the pole itself .
my record was minus 2.5 miles .
this was my little bit of bio-mimicry .
and i got three voicemails .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- -lrb- video -rrb- : ninety .
it 's a special feeling .
the - the whole world underneath me .
we 'd like to pick you up .
i thought , it 'll have to do .
the co-@@ pilot was a lady called monica .
he put his hand on the throttle .
what 's next : antarctica .
that 's pretty much it .
we believe all sorts of things .
so let 's do a thought experiment .
your name is lucy , okay ?
and you hear a rustle in the grass .
you 've just won a darwin award .
and so i think that we evolved ...
and is it really a horse ?
or is it more like a frog ?
and what do you see here ?
some people see a dal@@ ma@@ tian dog .
what do you see here ?
just shout out anything you see .
that 's a good audience , chris .
anybody see an object there ?
here is what you show subjects .
they increase the amount of dopamine .
you think people are talking about you .
and we then call that schizophrenia .
and what pattern do you see here ?
pretty sexy feet , i must say .
because the lights on here .
and so your brain is fooled .
well , why is this happening ?
so you recognize obama immediately .
what 's the difference between those ?
some patterns are real and some are not .
some conspir@@ acies really are true .
explains a lot , maybe .
we did a whole issue on it .
it 's just a minute and a half .
go ahead and roll it .
woman : take a step here .
and , jennifer , how did that feel ?
these first images are from greenland .
but ice has another meaning .
science is not arguing about that .
and that led me to this project .
and several things are important .
that 's the natural cycle .
but 2@@ 80 is the peak .
earth is having a fever .
we have to turn that around .
that 's the retreat of this glacier .
now we turn on our time lapse .
this camera was shooting every hour .
geologic process in action here .
the images make the invisible visible .
these huge crevas@@ ses open up .
it 's a long way .
you can see this river being formed .
you can see it defl@@ ating .
we go back a couple years in time .
that 's where it started .
the interior of greenland is to the right .
we had nine cameras going .
we have a problem of perception .
i 'm certain that we can .
it 's actually a fairly common picture .
their names are pat@@ rice and pate@@ e .
the animals are simply gone .
i 'm going to be talking about this .
this is challenging work to do .
just a few quick before and after shots .
this is what it looks like now .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- no comment .
we made a number of discoveries .
that gave us a tremendous amount of hope .
why are they engaging with cyberspace ?
people would keep talking about it for weeks .
and you may wonder why .
and first it 's quite simple .
now it 's all available online .
so this is something you have to recognize .
and we use the word " nothing . "
this all started when i was age five .
my world was seen as less .
so you 'd just see her feet .
and then i saw her legs .
but i did n't get it .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- so i did .
it became part of me .
some of them were quite jag@@ ged .
i found these little bits of glass .
and i had to make them square .
and it went like this ...
and then that was it .
and i decided to build it up .
but i managed to do it .
i noticed that the house was occupied .
have we ever heard of a dust mite ?
then static electricity set in .
decided to make a paintbrush .
and i looked at it underneath the microscope .
and it starts to dry very quickly .
so i have to be very quick .
so i have to be very very careful .
i would say it probably measures ...
and she saw me walking around like this .
and the horse is made from nylon .
it must be a machine . "
so i wanted to have that little image .
so i broke the needle .
they go in with their own friction .
constructed each plank of gold .
and the whole thing is sort of symmetrical .
