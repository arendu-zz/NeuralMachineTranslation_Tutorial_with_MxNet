do you know that surgery ?
we do not think that way .
" great ! excellent ! "
and i saw a sign .
well , they signed me up immediately .
yeah . they needed some young blood .
you can mimic what you can see .
and they deserve more than that . "
and it ca n't be done .
we put this thing together .
this weighs 6.@@ 9 pounds .
going to scratch his nose .
it 's got 14 active degrees of freedom .
baking soda and vine@@ gar .
they use solid propellant most frequently .
it 's a strange kind of love .
here was a drag race .
up , up , up .
this is the world we live in .
it 's already flatten@@ ing out .
this is why it 's happening .
but hey , you 're listening to me .
so you 've got that covered .
but we do not know his face .
so , what do you think ?
i find that hard to believe .
so let 's try to find them .
so we can eliminate all the profiles .
it also has to be sufficiently detailed .
they are made in the right order .
the icon of icons finally has a face .
here he is : leonardo da vinci .
they all have bank accounts .
and the rest says it all .
and i want to tell you that story .
craig venter chairs that event .
we set out to do this .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and he wanted to go .
so we did a second parab@@ ola .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- he was so happy .
please join us in this epic adventure .
before , they were closed off .
now what are some of the results ?
and think of the laptop as a vaccine .
you do n't vaccinate a few children .
seemed to be the passion today .
that 's what i want to talk about .
will geeks become endangered species ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- global warming fun .
you should stay cool with the appropriate clothing .
digital scrotum , digital media .
and this is what the young generation says .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- 4 am in the morning .
but what did he appeal to ?
invest , invest , invest . "
and he appealed to virtue .
virtue is an old-fashioned word .
let me begin with an example .
at ted , brilliance is rampant .
it 's a story about lemon@@ ade .
so he brought it back .
how do things like this happen ?
better ones , more of them .
the second tool we reach for is incentives .
better ones , more of them .
what else , after all , is there ?
regulate , regulate , regulate .
here 's an example from chicago kindergarten .
we know why these scripts are there .
there was going to be a national referendum .
they knew it was dangerous .
we see this in medicine .
one : celebrate moral exemp@@ lars .
people are inspired by moral heroes .
be proud that you have them .
two were particularly inspiring to me .
his employees are inspired by the effort .
the camera is always on .
they need to learn to respect themselves .
they need to learn to respect their teachers .
that 's the principle objective .
and i think he was right .
he also appealed to hope .
barry schwar@@ tz : thank you very much .
now follow me , ok ?
one , two , three .
i guess it 's just like life .
we can interfere with the interface .
you do n't say a prayer .
you do n't chant an " om . "
so three things have happened .
the bubbles are the countries .
and this is what happens .
the blue there is india .
because this is where we are .
will it be possible that this will happen ?
i expect to live 100 years .
and this is where we are today .
we 'll swap the axis .
some countries still had statistics .
you see the importance of that ?
it moves this way over here .
and the volvo is doing quite fine .
and this is my family .
and sweden was like mozambique .
i 'm the mexican in the family .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- but homage to singapore .
singapore is the best one .
and what happens when we moved on ?
and there we are , 2001 .
from now on we count per capita .
the world is quite a messy place .
this we can call dollar street .
everyone lives on this street here .
this family earns about one dollar per day .
this can change . this can change .
we can get out of poverty .
it 's about having food .
it 's also good with credit .
but you can do that .
you make a powerpoint , you know ?
everyone wants your pet thing .
education , human resources are important .
we are not interested in money .
money is not a goal .
environment is very , very crucial .
but where are the important goals ?
of course , it 's human rights .
that 's the value of living .
so the seemingly impossible is possible .
even african countries can achieve this .
we can have a good world .
can i request a moment of absolute silence ?
it 's 27 kilometers in circum@@ ference .
they 're essentially digital cameras .
but there 's a problem .
can anyone see what it is ?
h stands for higgs particle .
higgs particles , if you will .
they 're interacting with the higgs field .
so that 's one thing .
well , they do change in strength .
so that 's the lhc .
you might want to leave now .
and he said that was impossible .
and so i built the ven@@ ding machine .
but the researchers had a problem .
but she did it all on her own .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- it 's fairly interesting .
wait for the light to stop the traffic .
parents seem to be teaching their young .
so that 's what we did .
this is a ven@@ ding machine for crows .
that 's me at my desk .
that 's my daughter , jean .
that 's my daughter and me .
my children , da@@ ve@@ y and henry .
this time you can have three words .
so , why was psychology good ?
no one works on that .
so that was not good .
the first happy life is the pleasant life .
that 's what aristotle was talking about .
and third , the meaningful life .
and the third path is meaning .
it 's being done in a rigorous manner .
so those are examples of positive interventions .
the pursuit of engagement is also very strong .
the aggregate numbers are overwhelming .
the question is , why ?
now we 're shining right back up .
this is not a copy .
they would bring them back and mount them .
so that 's for fun .
in 14@@ 55 , nobody could read .
we 're going to have some tomorrow .
this is the library of human imagination .
the room itself is three stories tall .
there 's my very own saturn v.
so it 's a leap of imagination .
it 's all about connections .
these two molecules code and decode .
and i 'll give you a quick example .
how dare we be optimistic ?
let me show you these slides here .
that puts a lot of pressure on greenland .
they have exactly the same amount of carbon .
here 's the stratosphere : cooler .
so here 's what we 're doing .
and it is based on an old model .
but we have a planetary emergency .
we have the capacity to do it .
" now , even lower emissions ! "
use the internet . go on the internet .
-lrb- applause -rrb- hello everyone .
are you ready to go ? ok .
so a few of the stories .
all these pictures are from zimbabwe .
i 'm just the messenger .
your heart gets more blood flow .
these differences were highly significant .
half of guys who smoke are impotent .
they were combined in the media .
we 're doing changing media .
we do them for our clients .
" worrying solves nothing . "
singapore was quite in discussion .
and the very last one is a billboard .
we let that lie around in the sun .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- thank you so much .
it exploded an arms race .
it began the space race .
but sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
" sputnik " will soon be released .
and i 'd like to thank you all .
and the professional , historical linguists in the u.s.
ca : where ? what country ?
w@@ k : yeah . the windmill .
ca : how much electricity ?
w@@ k : 12 watts .
w@@ k : four bulbs and two radios .
thank you so much for coming .
