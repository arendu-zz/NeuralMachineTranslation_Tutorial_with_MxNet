here 's how you mail your letter .
but there are many other dimensions to pakistan .
my name is z@@ am@@ in .
my name is papu@@ say .
a rising tide lifts all boats .
i found that really moving .
it felt like it was really important .
i just really wanted to acknowledge you .
-lrb- applause -rrb- thank you so much .
and this map is also accurate .
i have a daughter , mu@@ lan .
and i said , " i know .
so how could that ever happen ? "
and i said , " yes . "
and i said , " yes . "
and i said , ... " "
i do n't understand the legs . "
she goes , " what about dogs ? "
that would never happen . "
so , let 's roll the video .
how can you use this stuff ?
we 're focusing now on port-au-prince .
what you see here is a premature baby .
four million of these babies die annually .
this is a pha@@ se-@@ change material .
this is a real thing .
received very favor@@ ably by business .
they have been tested in the laboratory .
we see all this complexity .
and so that 's a big challenge .
it 's been constantly going up .
first , we 've got population .
that 's headed up to about nine billion .
we have something that 's not going up .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
who 's going to be sure ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that 's a tough one .
it is kind of a crazy idea .
so this is a wish .
so , what do we have to do ?
we need to go for more research funding .
we need to get the message out .
chris anderson : thank you . thank you .
and even lom@@ bor@@ g has changed .
so why was i st@@ alling ?
it 's called week@@ day veg .
on the weekend , your choice .

but there 's another reason as well .
and then they execute on it .
who does the very best ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
and i tried something interesting .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of prototyping .
there 's step-by-step instructions on this .
and that can make a big difference .
so , please forgive me .
just think about this problem for a second .
we 're looking at neurons here .
so , here you have my last slide .
so , here 's what happens .
i 'll get my sleeve back .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i hold the knife in my hand .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- sort of .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- yes , there it is .
and should they ever come in contact ...
i want to show you two examples .
the first is 4@@ sh@@ ba@@ b .
and they look something like this .
and it 's called " the 99 . "
it 's now a theme park .
there is an animated series in the works .
my train was a heart attack .
" could my doctor have warned me ? "
and you know why i understand that ?
what does that mean , my environment ?
oh , not so lucky .
so , here 's my friend paul .
did you know that data existed ?
this might be what we end up with .
this could be my little assessment .
but it will also be useful for us .
okay , that was kind of cool .
britain will starve without genetically modified crops .
and it took them four days .
welcome to the new world .
round@@ ab@@ outs are much better .
what 's that time worth ?
and you 'd still come out ahead .

we gave cycle ri@@ ck@@ sha@@ ws .
and this is what we turn them into .
we rescued over 5@@ 50 dancing bears .
for example : is this evil ?
wipe it up , throw it away .
this is now operating energy .
and now all bets are off .
so first , we demolish it .
we then put in framing .
so what does this mean ?
let me read you the entry .
here 's the updated version of this entry .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
it 's part of our life .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
maybe we can see it as change .
now , who 's normal ?
-lrb- laughter -rrb- i do n't think so .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- oh , that guy .
i became one of the working homeless .
his death hit me pretty hard .
i did n't always succeed .
but i had changed somehow .
because i was a writer .
and i started writing again .
i was no longer homeless .
and i was no longer invisible .
there is no way back home .
so let 's forget your environmental footprint .
let 's think about your ethical footprint .
well , you probably recognize the first person .
it all begins with enjoyment .
con@@ te@@ stants also put themselves forward .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- no small thing .
it was 23 metric tons for one liter .
and i studied very much in sweden .

washington , d.c. went out here .
it 's quite interesting , is n't it ?
now , back to my projections .
growth is starting , economic reform .
you see it came down there .
you see , japan did it like that .
we add japan to it .
can you see here what japan did ?
this boy is called zen@@ ola .
this boy is called sa@@ di@@ k .
this boy is called mess@@ oud .
